<p class="drop-capx">Wherever Scottish troops have fought the sound of the
pipes has been heard, speaking to us of our beloved
native land, bringing back to our memories the proud traditions
of our race, and stimulating our spirits to fresh efforts in the
cause of freedom. The cry of "The Lament" over our fallen
heroes has reminded us of the undying spirit of the Scottish race,
and of the sacredness of our cause.</p>

<p>The Pipers of Scotland may well be proud of the part they
have played in this war. In the heat of battle, by the lonely
grave, and during the long hours of waiting, they have called to
us to show ourselves worthy of the land to which we belong.
Many have fallen in the fight for liberty, but their memories
remain. Their fame will inspire others to learn the pipes, and
keep alive their music in the Land of the Gael.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p class="noindent">This record of the achievements of pipers during the war of 1914-18 is not
intended to be an appeal to emotionalism. It aims at showing that, in spite
of the efforts of a very efficient enemy to prevent individual gallantry, in
spite of the physical conditions of the modern battlefield, the pipes of war,
the oldest instrument in the world, have played an even greater part in
the orchestra of battle in this than they have in past campaigns.</p>

<p>The piper, be he Highlander, or Lowlander, or Scot from Overseas,
has accomplished the impossible&mdash;not rarely and under favourable
conditions, but almost as a matter of routine; and to him not Scotland
only but the British Empire owes more than they have yet
appreciated.</p>

<p>In doing so he has sacrificed himself; and Scotland&mdash;and the world&mdash;must
face the fact that a large proportion of the men who played the
instrument and kept alive the old traditions have completed their self-imposed
task. With 500 pipers killed and 600 wounded something must be
done to raise a new generation of players; it is a matter of national importance
that this should be taken in hand at once, and that the sons of those
who have gone should follow in the footsteps of their fathers.</p>

<p>This is the best tribute that can be offered to them.</p>

<p>The Piobaireachd Society intend to institute a Memorial School of
piping for this purpose, and all profits from the sale of this book will be
handed over to their fund.</p>

<p>The compilation of the statistical portions of the work has involved
correspondence with commanding officers, pipe presidents and pipe majors
of many units in the Imperial armies; to them, for their enthusiastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
assistance in obtaining information, is due the credit for the mass of detail
that has been made available.</p>

<p>To the other contributors&mdash;authors, artists and poets&mdash;is due in large
measure such success as may follow the publication of this work. They
have helped a cause worthy of their efforts.</p>

<p>It is earnestly to be hoped that Scotland will rise to the occasion. To
the compilers it has been a privilege to record the achievements of men&mdash;many
of them personal friends&mdash;who contributed so largely to the success
of their gallant regiments.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

<p class="drop-capx">The history of the bagpipes as a military institution is a long and
honourable one, inseparable from that of Scottish troops, Highland
and Lowland, wherever they have fought, for centuries past. The strains
of <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">piob mhor</i> have been heard all over those bloody European battlefields
on which Scottish soldiers of fortune died&mdash;too often for lost causes&mdash;from
the time when Buchan's force joined the Lilies of France in 1422, throughout
the Hundred Years' War, in the Low Countries, in Germany, in Austria;
and they have handed on a tradition which has been lived up to in the
later days of the regular Scottish units of the British Army.</p>

<p>But memories are short; and, in the army as elsewhere, the passion
for reform before the greatest war of all was threatening many old-established
institutions whose utility was not immediately apparent.</p>

<p>And so it came about that to many observers, indeed to a considerable
section of military opinion, it appeared likely that along with the kilt,
the use of tartan, bonnet, doublet and other special features of the dress
of Scottish regiments, the bagpipe must be regarded as a picturesque
anachronism destined to disappear as the conditions of war changed and
as the yearning of high military authorities for a deadly khaki uniformity
of clothing and equipment became more insistent.</p>

<p>"Why," it has often been said, "should Scottish units find it necessary,
either in peace or on active service to retain an obsolete musical instrument of
their own? In days past, before the rifle had revolutionised tactics, when
shooting was erratic at 100 yards' range, there might have been something
to say for an instrument which experience showed to be capable of stimulating
men at the psychological moment when effort was failing; but is it reasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
to expect that the educated twentieth century soldier will prove to be
responsive to any such stimulus&mdash;even if it were possible, under modern
conditions of rifle and shell fire, to provide it?"</p>

<p>The reply to such a line of argument is clear enough; and its truth
has been demonstrated in every action in which Scottish troops have taken
part during the war.</p>

<p>The strength of an army depends, to an incalculable degree, on the
strength not only of individual regimental <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</i>, but of the national
sentiment of its units. The retention of time-honoured territorial titles
in the New Armies, instead of a soulless numbering of units, was itself
due to a recognition by the authorities of the principle that the individual
soldier is a better fighting man when he feels that he has to live up to an
ancient and brilliant regimental record. The Rifleman, even in peace,
would never voluntarily be transferred to a "red" regiment, nor does
a 10th Hussar yearn for the cuirass of the Life Guardsman. When a man
joins a regiment, voluntarily or compulsorily, he adopts for the whole
period of his military service the customs, the prejudices, and the traditions
of his unit, and is himself moulded by them in a manner which is as
inexplicable as it is marked.</p>

<p>And if regimental <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> and tradition are strong, national
and territorial sentiment are stronger. In the old army, as a result of the
system of recruitment, this factor was of less importance than in the,
comparatively speaking, unmixed units of the new army of to-day. All
our military history shows that the appeal to such national sentiment
is as certain in its effects as the appeal to regimental tradition; and this
war has enormously accentuated its importance.</p>

<p>All observers agree&mdash;and military despatches confirm the view&mdash;that
the rivalry of national sentiment has proved invaluable; units, whether
battalions or divisions, have literally competed for distinction for their
own nationality, and have succeeded in associating particular exploits
with themselves for ever. It may truly be said that behind the achievements
of the 9th, 15th, 51st and 52nd and Canadian Divisions the motive impulse
was national rather than merely regimental.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>In the keeping alive of this national sentiment in Scottish units, their
distinctive dress and, still more, the retention of the national instrument,
have played an important part; and this applies with equal force to units
composed of Scotsmen who have left their native land permanently or
temporarily.</p>

<p>Throughout the war these units have more than maintained the great
traditions of their past history, carrying on the records of Scottish gallantry
which have been excelled by no troops in the world and equalled by few.</p>

<p>And so with the pipers.</p>

<p>How important a contributory cause they have been to the success
of their battalions is recognized by all alike, men and officers&mdash;and not
least by the Field Marshal Commanding in Chief. In spite of modern
conditions they have, in cases too numerous to record, played the part
which was normally theirs in the olden days of set battles.</p>

<p>To many of the men in the ranks the music of the pipes in peace time
may have had no special association other than with dances and gatherings;
but whenever the piper assumed his historic <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i>&mdash;so long dormant&mdash;of
fighting man, the inherited peculiarities of the Scottish soldier were aroused
and the music made an overpowering appeal to his national sentiment.</p>

<p>Inherited sympathy of this kind is no doubt inexplicable&mdash;but it exists.
It certainly cannot be ascribed to the Celtic strain in <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'invididuals'">individuals</ins>, for we
know that the bagpipe was in general use for centuries all over the Lowlands&mdash;perhaps
even before it displaced the bard and the harper and became
the war instrument of the Highlands. We cannot analyse what Neil Munro
describes as "the tune with the river in it, the fast river and the courageous,
that kens not stop nor tarry, that runs round rock and over fall with a
good humour, yet no mood for anything but the way before it"; we only
know that it works on some individuals and some races as no other instrument
does, and we need not try to satisfy ourselves whether this is due
to the flat seventh in the scale, or the ever-sounding drones, or the inherited
memory it arouses.</p>

<p>The idea that the piper would be too conspicuous an object to be employed
in his proper capacity has proved to be partly true, as indicated by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
casualties among them when playing; but the same argument might be
applied to any other soldier in the ranks. Shells show no discrimination
in their objective.</p>

<p>To a certain extent this objection is a sound one; but it is all a matter
of relative values. Many commanding officers have expressed the opinion
that at times when, on account of the all-pervading noise of the
battlefield, not a note of his music could be heard by the men nearest
to him, it was the actual presence of the piper that supplied the stimulus
to the men; in fact, it was the piper, not his instrument, that was
followed.</p>

<p>For obvious reasons pipers are harder to replace than the ordinary
soldier, and, in trench warfare especially, most regiments have tried to
keep them in relative security; but in the records of units which follow it will
be seen that, when the trouble comes, the piper has always been to the
fore, and "the tune with the tartan of the clan in it" has been heard again
as it has for centuries past.</p>

<p>From the military point of view the bagpipe has the merit of accentuating
national sentiment at just those moments when the stimulus is most necessary,
of rousing the "<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">mir cath</i>," the frenzy of battle, and of rallying men when the
ideal is liable to be lost sight of in the presence of the nerve shattering
realities of action.</p>

<p>In all these ways the company pipers have justified their existence.
In the discharge of a duty which may be regarded as sentimental in the
highest sense of the term, they have, literally by hundreds, made the
supreme sacrifice; wherever Scottish units have fought these men have
exposed themselves, unhesitatingly, recklessly, playing their companies
to the attack in conditions which, as regards intensity of personal risk,
have never previously been experienced. Many battalions have lost all
their pipers more than once, but, as long as reinforcements were available,
there has never been any difficulty in getting fresh men out of the ranks
or from home to take their place; and the new men have followed the old,
just as heedless, as they played their comrades forward, knowing quite well
that for many of them the urlar of "<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Baile Inneraora</i>" or "<em>The March<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of the Cameron men</em>" might suddenly change to the taorluath of "<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd"><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Ch till mi'">Cha
till mi</ins> tuille</i>."</p>

<p>The Germans at least, though they may not recognise the tune when
they hear it in the streets of Cologne, appreciated the grim significance of
<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">piob mhor</i> when "<em>I hear the pibroch sounding, sounding</em>" followed the lifting
of the barrage.</p>

<p>The war also has afforded many instances of another function of the
pipes in action. Charging the enemy at a foot pace through deep mud
is after all but a "crowded hour of glorious life," which may or may not
be completely or even partially successful, and men may have to be rallied
when their nerves have given out under intolerable strain. Of this there
have been several instances.</p>

<p>It must not, of course, be imagined that regimental pipers, during
this or any other war, have been normally employed in playing their units
to the attack; the whole condition of modern fighting makes this impossible
in the same way and for the same reason that it has made impossible spectacular
charges by battalions in line.</p>

<p>It would be a more accurate presentment of the case to say that the
military piper, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">qua</i> piper, normally exercises his functions behind the front
line, in billets and on the line of march; and in this respect he resembles
other army musicians whose duty&mdash;according to old Army Regulations
of 300 years ago&mdash;is "to excite cheerfulness and alacrity in the soldier."</p>

<p>But, recognising all this, the peculiarity of the piper is that, in open
fighting, when his unit has been committed to the attack, he often assumes
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i> which distinguishes him from all other musicians, and takes his
place at the head of his company.</p>

<p>Instances of this during the war are innumerable, and those which are
detailed below are but typical of what has occurred in every field of operations,
and in most units which possessed pipers.</p>

<p>And if it is impossible to say too much of the regimental pipers of the
British Army, it is equally so in the case of those of Overseas units, notably
of the Canadians. From the point of view of the historian who wishes
to demonstrate what pipers have done during this war, no more remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
case could be selected than that of the 16th Canadian Scottish. The pipers
of this distinguished battalion won one V.C., one D.C.M., one Military
Medal and Bar, and eight plain Military Medals&mdash;a record which is unique.
No man was put up for a decoration unless he had played his company over
the top at least twice, and no piper was ever ordered to play in action&mdash;it
was left to volunteers, who, it was found, had to resort to the drawing of
lots to obtain the coveted privilege of playing.</p>

<p>The colonel of the regiment&mdash;himself a V.C.&mdash;commenting on the
casualties says: "I believe the purpose of war is to win victories, and if
one can do this better by encouraging certain sentiments and traditions
why shouldn't it be done? The heroic and dramatic effect of a piper
stoically playing his way across the ghastly modern battlefield, altogether
oblivious to danger, has an extraordinary effect on the spirit and enterprise of
his comrades. His example inspires all those about him."</p>

<p>And so it comes to this: the method of employment of the regimental
piper during this war has depended largely on opportunity&mdash;and still more
on the individuality of commanding officers. Men vary within very wide
limits in the price they are prepared to pay for attaining their object;
and where one man will deliberately sacrifice a certain number of men to
get a position, another will as deliberately avoid the sacrifice, even if it
costs him his objective.</p>

<p>As far as pipers are concerned, the decision arrived at by commanding
officers of the two schools is equally indicative of the esteem in which they
hold them.</p>

<h2><a name="A_HISTORY_OF_THE_PIPES" id="A_HISTORY_OF_THE_PIPES"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">A HISTORY OF THE PIPES</a></h2>

<p class="drop-capx">At what stages of his development primitive man discovered he could
obtain musical sounds by blowing on a hollow reed we cannot now
ascertain; if we could do so we could at once determine when the pipe
came into existence. It is unprofitable to speculate on this point.</p>

<p>What we do know, however, is that men playing the pipe are portrayed
in sculptures the date of which is fixed by the best authorities as about
4000 <span class="fs80">B.C.</span>, and we conclude that in Chaldaea, Egypt, Assyria and Persia
at least, the pipe&mdash;but not necessarily the bagpipe&mdash;had become a recognised
musical instrument.</p>

<p>Actual specimens of the Egyptian pipe dating back to at least 1500 <span class="fs80">B.C.</span>
are in existence, and we know that they had a reed giving a scale almost
identical with the chromatic scale; they also had a drone. Such a pipe
had, clearly, advanced some way on the upward development to "<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">piob
mhor</i>."</p>

<p>Every stage in its evolution still persists in some country in the world,
and by comparing these it is possible to trace the actual process. Thus,
besides the single pipe, which is world-wide in its distribution, we have
the Egyptian "arghool," which consists of a pipe "chanter" and drone
lying side by side; and the later development, the "zummarah," has a bag.
In India the twentieth century snake charmer has an instrument in which
chanter and single drone lie side by side fixed into a small gourd with a
lump of wax. The chanter has a small reed very similar to our own chanter
reeds, and, although the scale differs, the sound produced is remarkably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>similar. This instrument is essentially a single drone bagpipe, and is to be
found all over India, in Yunnan and other parts of China.</p>

<div class="blockquotyy">

<p><em>Note.</em>&mdash;The author takes this opportunity of acknowledging his indebtedness for much of the early
history of the instrument to Manson's <cite>The Highland Bagpipe</cite> and Dr. Grattan Flood's <cite>The Story of the
Bagpipe</cite>, both monuments of research.</p></div>

<p>It would have been more than surprising if the pipe, in some form or
other, had not been used in ancient Greece and Rome. There are, in fact,
very many references to it in classical literature, and by 100 <span class="fs80">A.D.</span> we know
that the "askaulos" had evolved into the bagpipe proper, and Chrysostomos
speaks of a man who could "play the pipe with his mouth on the bag placed
under his armpit."</p>

<p>Martial, Suetonius, Seneca, and other Latin writers refer to the "tibia
utricularis," and there is practically no doubt that it was used as a marching
instrument in the armies of Julius Caesar. A bronze showing a Roman
soldier in marching order playing the utriculus has been discovered in
England, and the writer Procopius refers to Roman pipe bands in this
country.</p>

<p>But when we come to the question of the introduction of the bagpipe
into the British Isles, and especially into Scotland, we are at once on highly
controversial ground.</p>

<p>It is obvious enough that the instrument is not peculiar to the Celtic
races; that it has maintained its hold on them long after its disappearance
in other European nations is equally so. But who introduced it into these
favoured isles, whether the Cruithne or Prydani or Picts or the later "C"
Gaidheal branch of the Celtic stem&mdash;who shall say?</p>

<p>Some authorities&mdash;students of the subject would be a safer term&mdash;are
prepared to assert that the bagpipe was introduced first into England,
thence to Lowland Scotland, and only long afterwards into the Highlands;
and one recent writer in the <cite>Celtic Magazine</cite> says the evidence of its association
with the Scottish Gaels does not go back beyond the middle of the
sixteenth century!</p>

<p>The matter is one of academic interest, no doubt, but there is no likelihood
of its ever being settled.</p>

<p>Records did not exist in the ancient Highlands, and we have to turn
to early Irish literature for reference to the bagpipe. In the Brehon Laws
of the fifth century it is spoken of as the "cuisle"; and, although Tara's halls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
are usually associated with the harp, it is recorded that at the assemblies
which took place there in pre-Christian days it was the custom for the
pipes to play at the banquets.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>It is possible the bagpipe was brought over from the north of Ireland,
"Scotia" as it then was, on the invasion of the Highlands by Cairbre Riada,
who founded the kingdom of Dalriada in Argyle in <span class="fs80">A.D.</span> 120; or in the
later great colonisation, about <span class="fs80">A.D.</span> 506, under Lorne and Angus, the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'sons of Erc'">sons
of Ere</ins>.</p>

<p>It certainly does not appear likely that the bagpipe came over from
"Scotia" in the first place, unless we are to accept the view that the Scottish
Celt came over by the same route; unfortunately we have very little
accurate knowledge of the early history of the Highlands, and there are
no local written records extant to prove&mdash;as they do in the case of Ireland&mdash;that
the instrument existed in those early days. We do know that
the harper and the bard were national institutions of immense antiquity
in the Highlands, and that, as the bagpipe became an increasingly important
feature of everyday life, they were bitterly opposed to it.</p>

<p>Even Latin authors, who were familiar with the bagpipe as a marching
instrument in their own army, omit to refer to the existence of <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">piob mhor</i>
in the Highlands. The Greek writer Procopius, in 530 <span class="fs80">A.D.</span>, dismisses
the Highlands with the statement that "in the west the air is infectious
and mortal, the ground covered with serpents, and this dreary solitude
is the region of departed spirits." And so we are thrown back on tradition.</p>

<p>In the absence of records of the employment of the bagpipe in war
in the Highlands it is to Ireland, the so-called Lowlands of Scotland and to
England that we have to turn for information; at the same time we must
bear in mind that evolution of the instrument itself had begun to operate,
and the English and Lowland pipes were different from the variety now
known as the "Highland," which has supplanted all others.</p>

<p>As regards Ireland it is known that the Irish troops who fought in
Gascony in 1286 had pipers with them, and a drawing of their instrument
appears in a manuscript of 1300 <span class="fs80">A.D.</span> in the British Museum. There were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>also Irish pipers at the battle of Falkirk in 1298, and they are again referred
to in contemporary accounts of the battle of Creçy.</p>

<p>The military piper therefore goes far back into history. But it was
as a social instrument that one finds most frequent reference to bagpipes
of some pattern or other in the Middle Ages. There was a pipe band at
the English Court in 1327, and an old inventory of 1419 shows that at the
Palace of St. James' were "foure baggpypes with pypes of ivorie ... the
bagge covered with purple vellat."</p>

<p>But, whereas the English pipes went the same way as the Continental
varieties, it was otherwise in Scotland. Two institutions existed there
which fostered the tradition and saved <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">piob mhor</i> from the fate of disappearance&mdash;the
Burgh piper and the Clan piper; and by 1450 <span class="fs80">A.D.</span> these had
certainly become part of the national life.</p>

<p>In Edinburgh in 1487 <span class="fs80">A.D.</span> there were three town pipers, who were paid
three pence daily; one of their duties was "to accompany the toun's
drummer throw toun morning and evening." In 1505 <span class="fs80">A.D.</span> the town records
of Dumbarton, Biggar, Wigton, Dumfries and Linlithgow refer to burgh
pipers.</p>

<p>In Aberdeen in 1630 <span class="fs80">A.D.</span> exception appears to have been taken to the
custom of playing through the streets, as it is placed on record that this
was to be stopped "it being an uncivill forme to be usit uithin sic a famous
burghe, and being oftene found fault uith als weill be sundrie niehbouris
as by strangeris." That the citizens of this "famous burghe" are peculiarly
susceptible to the criticisms of "strangeris" might never have been suspected
by superficial observers, and it is well that there is official testimony to
the fact.</p>

<p>The effect of their daily music on the inhabitants of Perth was different,&mdash;or
perhaps Perth was less amenable to the criticisms of "strangeris." In
any case it is recorded of a burgh piper, who used to rouse the citizens at
5 a.m., that his music was "inexpressibly soothing and delightful."</p>

<p>At Dundee the piper played through the town "every day in the morning
at four hours and every nicht at aucht hours," and was paid twelve pennies
yearly by each householder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>The pipes, at least in the pre-Reformation days&mdash;were sometimes played
in church; in course of time, however, piping on Sunday scandalised the
authorities, religious and civil, and, in the burgh records, we find repeated
instances of pipers being punished for this misdemeanour.</p>

<p>The burgh piper was a man of peace; the clan piper was a man of war.
For many centuries he had to compete with the "clarsair," or harper, and
the bard, and aroused feelings of acute hostility from the latter. In 1411 <span class="fs80">A.D.</span>
one bard, MacMhurich of Clan Ranald, wrote a poem of a most uncomplimentary
nature about the bagpipes.</p>

<p>The recitation of the bard before battle was probably last heard at
Harlaw in 1411, and the clan bards disappeared finally in 1726; the last
clan harper died in 1739, and the "croistara"&mdash;the fiery cross&mdash;was sent
round the clans for the last time in the '45. The last Scottish piper will
pass when the Scottish race itself passes&mdash;which will certainly be the last
of all.</p>

<p>The clan pipers were highly esteemed as musicians&mdash;from the musical
point of view they, no doubt, left us far behind. The courses of training,
lasting over years, at the old piping schools such as existed at Boreraig,
turned a man into a piper. As Neil Munro has it: "To the make of a
piper go seven years of his own learning and seven generations before; at
the end of his seven years one born to it will stand at the start of knowledge,
and, leaning a fond ear to the drone, he may have parley with old folks
of old affairs."</p>

<p>One of the results of the Heritable Jurisdiction Act of 1747, which
so completely altered the conditions of life in the Highlands, was the
disappearance of the office of hereditary clan piper.</p>

<p>The tunes these men played were the old tunes we know so well; and
so it has happened that in this war we find companies marching into and
through machine-gun and artillery barrage and into broken French villages
and through German trenches while the company piper plays the same
melodies that inspired their forebears to fight their neighbours lang syne&mdash;melodies
which have been heard, too, in the same part of the world in the
days when Scottish troops fought for the Lilies of France against all comers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>The association of the bagpipe with military operations is probably
very ancient in Scotland. Perhaps the tradition that the Menzies pipers
played at Bannockburn rests on an insecure foundation, but if the Bruce
had no pipers, his son David most certainly had, as witness the Exchequer
Rolls. In 1549 a French writer states that "the wild Scots encouraged
themselves to arms by the sound of their bagpipes"; and in 1598 Alexander
Hume of Logie wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Caus michtilie the warlic nottes brake</p>
<p class="verse">On Heiland pipes, Scottes and Hyberniche.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Incidentally, this reference to three different kinds of pipes is interesting.</p>

<p>The first authentic reference to pipers in the Forces of the Crown appears
to have been in 1627, when Alex. Macnaughton of Loch Fyne-side was
commissioned by King Charles I. to "levie and transport twa hundredthe
bowmen" for service in the French war. Writing in January 1628 to the
Earl of Morton, Macnaughton says:</p>

<p>"As for newis from our selfis, our baggpyperis and marlit plaidis
serwitt us in guid wise in the pursuit of ane man of war that hetlie
followed us."</p>

<p>The records show that this company had a harper, "Harrie M'Gra frae
Larg," and a piper, "Allester Caddell," who, in accordance with the custom
of the time, had his gillie to carry his pipes for him.</p>

<p>Regimental pipers undoubtedly existed in the numerous bodies of
Scottish troops which served at various times on the Continent. Thus,
in 1586, in the "State of War" of Captain Balfour's company in the Scots
Brigade in Holland, there were two drummers and a piper; and in "the
worthy Scots regiment called Mackeye's" raised by Sir Donald Mackay
in 1626 there was an establishment of thirty-six pipers.</p>

<p>Pipers are also found on the rolls of the "regiment d'Hebron"&mdash;now
the Royal Scots&mdash;and to that very distinguished regiment we may safely
accord the further distinction of being the first "Regular" regiment of
the British Army to have pipes. The "North British Fusiliers," now
one of the battalions of the Royal Scots Fusiliers, also had pipes as far
back as 1678, and probably as early as 1642.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Writing in 1641, Lord Lothian said:</p>

<p>"I cannot out of our armie furnish you with a sober fiddler....
We are sadder and graver than ordinarie soldiers, only we are well
provided with pypers. I have one for every company in my regiment,
and I think they are as good as drummers."</p>

<p>The great Montrose had pipers in his armies, and tradition has it that,
in the action of Philiphaugh in 1645, a piper stood on a small eminence
and played the old Cavalier tune, "Whurry, Whigs, awa' man," until he was
shot by one of Leslie's men, and fell into the "Piper's Pule" in Ettrick river.</p>

<p>An exactly similar incident occurred in the case of one of the pipers
of Bonnie Dundee at Bothwell Brig in 1679.</p>

<p>At the Haughs o' Cromdale in 1690 a wounded piper climbed on to a
big rock and went on playing till he died, thus setting an example which
has been followed by his successors in many actions in this war. The
stone on which this unknown hero stood is known to this day locally as
"Clach a phiobair."</p>

<p>There are many such in France and elsewhere to-day.</p>

<p>In Wodrow's letters in 1716 there is a reference to the company pipers
of the "Argyle's Highlanders": "They entered in three companies, and
every company had their distinct pipers, playing three distinct springs.
The first played "The Campbells are coming" ... and when they entered
Dundee the people thought they had been some of Mar's men, till some
of the prisoners in the Tolbooth, understanding the first spring, swung the
words of it out of the windows, which mortified the Jacobites."</p>

<p>Again, in 1715, when Argyle's troops marched to Leith, it was stated
by Cockburn (Historical MSS. Commission): "While our generals were
asleep the rebels marched to Seton House, leaving the piper in the citadel
to amuse."</p>

<p>The piper, by this time, had clearly become a recognised military
institution.</p>

<p>In the '45 the unfortunate Sir John Cope was undoubtedly aroused
by the music of <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">piob mhor</i> at Prestonpans, though it is doubtful whether
"Hey Johnnie Cope" was composed for the occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Prince Charlie had thirty-two pipers of his own, besides those belonging
to the clans with him. One of these men, James Reid, was taken prisoner
in the operations of 1746. He pleaded that he had not carried arms, but
the Court decided that "no Highland regiment ever marched without a
piper: therefore his bag pipe, in the eye of the law, was an instrument
of war"&mdash;and they dealt with him accordingly.</p>

<p>This view was confirmed by the Disarming Act of 1747, which nearly
succeeded in attaining its object of abolishing the bagpipe, the kilt, the
tartan and national sentiment generally&mdash;only Regular regiments being
exempted from its operation.</p>

<p>Penal legislation against the bagpipe was no new thing. Cromwell
had tried it in Ireland, and, under William II., 600 Irish pipers and harpers
were persecuted with relentless rigour. And in Ireland it succeeded.</p>

<p>Saxon governments have always done the piper the honour of regarding
him as an exponent and supporter of national sentiment.</p>

<p>Even in Scotland the years between 1747 and 1782, when the iniquitous
Disarming Act was repealed, were very nearly fatal to the continued existence
of the bagpipe as a national institution; and it was the Regular Army which
saved it&mdash;though no one could ever accuse the military authorities of
unduly favouring the instrument. Even General Officers have publicly
sneered at them&mdash;as when Wolfe at Quebec contemptuously refused to
allow the pipes of the Fraser Highlanders to play, or when Sir Eyre Coote
in 1778 described them as a "useless relic of the barbarous ages."</p>

<p>Both generals had to withdraw what they had said.</p>

<p>The opinion of the Court Martial which tried poor James Reid, that
his bagpipe "was, in the eye of the law, an instrument of war," was after
all as shrewd an expression of the truth as their sentence was harsh.</p>

<p>In later times the pipes in the army have received little official recognition.
In 1858, when the King's Own Scottish Borderers applied for their pipers
to be placed on the establishment, the Commander in Chief grudgingly
consented "as the permission for these men is lost in time," but on
condition that they were not to cost the public anything as regards their
clothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor has the modern War Office shown more sympathy to an institution
whose value, even on theoretical grounds, should have been recognised.
The ancient and honourable title of Pipe Major has been abolished and
that of "sergeant piper" has been substituted. Pipers themselves, on
mobilisation, are returned to the ranks with the exception of six men. In
Lowland regiments, indeed, the piper, though tolerated, is not officially
recognised at all.</p>

<p>A bandsman may in due course become a first-class warrant officer&mdash;in
one or two units, indeed, he has attained commissioned rank; but the
"sergeant piper" remains a sergeant, and can hope for nothing more.
This, surely, is an injustice which is remediable at small cost to the nation.</p>

<p>The apathy of the War Office in regard to the training of pipers as pipers
is another matter which is in urgent need of reform. Commanding officers
and pipe presidents are sometimes pipers themselves&mdash;though not always;
it is absurd to leave to them the responsibility of training men in the art.
The time has come for a thorough reform of the whole system and method
of training of military pipe bands.</p>

<h3>THE WESTERN FRONT</h3>

<p class="drop-capx">During the autumn<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and winter of 1914-15 pipers, for obvious
reasons, had few opportunities of attracting much attention, still
less of performing their highest duty, viz. playing their companies into
action. They were necessarily, on account of the extreme shortage of men,
for the most part employed in the ranks; and in many of the old Regular
battalions pipe bands disappeared altogether.</p>

<p>For a time it seemed that the critics were right, and that in warfare
in the twentieth century there was no longer a place for a class of man
which was destined to disappear, as the bard and the harper had done in
days lang syne.</p>

<p>This view was widely held, and in some regiments was never modified.</p>

<p>But gradually, as attacks became more frequent and movements set
in, and as the British Army grew stronger in numbers, the position changed,
and the piper became more than an invaluable marching instrumentalist
or performer at <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">ceilidhs</i> in billets.</p>

<p>The first occasion on which pipers played, or tried to play, their companies
into action was at Cuinchy on 25th January 1915, when the 1st Black Watch
suffered such heavy casualties in advancing through deep mud up to their
knees.</p>

<p>It was at Neuve Chapelle in March 1915 that the company piper really
had his first chance of showing what he could do, as a piper, in action. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
this occasion the 20th Brigade had to carry the stronghold of Moulin du
Piètre, and lost very heavily; the 2nd Gordons were in the main attack
and the 6th Gordons, a Territorial unit, in reserve. The 6th Gordons
were called upon to support their comrades of the old Regular Army, and
advanced, headed by their pipes and drums, with a rush which carried many
of them beyond their objective.</p>

<p>From that time onwards, right up to the end of the war, pipers have
repeatedly played their units into action, in spite of the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'unfavourably'">unfavourable</ins>
conditions resulting from modern rifle and artillery fire and gas, and have
established the standard of gallantry in this respect which has been at
once the admiration of all observers and an incentive to their successors
to emulate them.</p>

<p>During the first weeks' heavy fighting, in April-May 1915, on the
left of the attenuated British line of the Ypres salient, the pipers of Canadian
battalions took a prominent part. In their advance on the St. Julien
wood the 16th Canadians were led by their company pipers, two of whom
were killed and two wounded while playing; their places were at once
taken by others, who played the battalion through the German trenches
at the heels of the retiring enemy to the tune "We'll tak' the guid auld
way." In many subsequent actions these men distinguished themselves
in the same way.</p>

<p>After the failure of the first attack on the German line at Rue des Bois
on 9th May 1915, in the action of Richebourg-Festubert, the 1st Black
Watch were played to a fresh attack by their company pipers. "With
their characteristic fury they had vanished into the smoke, and the only
evidence that remained was the sound of the pipes." When they reached
the German trenches a piper, Andrew Wishart, stood on the parados playing
until he was wounded. Another piper, W. Stewart, was awarded the
D.C.M. on this occasion.</p>

<p>The same thing happened in the case of the 2nd Black Watch at Festubert,
the companies being led by their pipers. Of these men two, Pipers Gordon
and Crichton, were specially mentioned for their gallantry. The Seaforth
pipers, too, suffered heavily in this as in many later actions&mdash;"Caber Feidh"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
has often been heard along that line which looked so weak, but was too
strong for the Germans.</p>

<p>In the action at Festubert on the 17th May the 4th Camerons got further
than any other battalion, and were played in by their pipe major, J. Ross,
and four pipers. These men got through untouched, though their pipes
were all injured.</p>

<p>Later again, on 16th June 1915, when the Hooge salient was straightened
by the 3rd Division, the attack was led by the 8th Brigade, and the enemy
front and support lines were taken. On this occasion Pipe Major Daniel
Campbell, although wounded, played his battalion, the 1st Royal Scots
Fusiliers, over the top.</p>

<p>Dawn was just breaking when the Pipe Major scrambled out on the
parapet and started playing. The men raced forward after him until
stopped by uncut wire. In the hand-to-hand fighting which ensued the
Pipe Major threw aside his pipes and, catching up a bayonet, joined in
the attack.</p>

<p>It was during the Ypres fighting, where gas was first used against us,
that an incident occurred of which the facts are as stated, but unfortunately
it has been found impossible to get the names of the men concerned.</p>

<p>"The men, looking into the storm of shells that swept their course
and at the awful cloud of death now almost on them, wavered, hung back&mdash;only
for a moment. And who will dare to blame them?</p>

<p>"Two of the battalion pipers who were acting as stretcher bearers saw
the situation in a moment. Dropping their stretcher they made for their
dug-out and emerged a second later with their pipes. They sprang on
the parapet, tore off their respirators and charged forward. Fierce and
terrible the wild notes cleft the air ... after fifteen yards the pibroch ceased;
the two pipers, choked and suffocated with the gas fumes, staggered and
fell."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Although in these earlier actions pipers had done much to maintain
the traditions of the past they had never had the opportunities of distinguishing
themselves that came to them during the great operations about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Loos in September 1915. The attack of two army corps, in which were
thirty Scottish battalions, along a seven-mile front, was a chance for these
men, and one of which they were not slow to avail themselves. Three
pipers at least earned the title of "The piper of Loos," and one of these,
Daniel Laidlaw, of the 7th King's Own Scottish Borderers, was awarded
the Victoria Cross; but, in the general orgie of gallantry which characterised
those operations, individual pipers in very many cases won the highest
praise in their own units but escaped the official recognition they had
earned.</p>

<p>The attack by the 28th Brigade on the Hohenzollern Redoubt was
accompanied by fearful casualties; with uncut wire in front, in an atmosphere
heavily laden with gas, exposed to machine-gun fire in front and
flank, the 6th K.O.S.B., 10th and 11th H.L.I. and 9th Seaforths were decimated.
The K.O.S.B. were played over the top by their veteran Pipe Major,
Robert Mackenzie, an old soldier of forty-two years' service. He was
severely wounded and died the following day.</p>

<p>On the right of this Brigade the 26th had better luck, as the wire was found
to be more thoroughly cut. The 5th Camerons and 7th Seaforths led the
way followed by the 8th Gordons and 8th Black Watch, and reached Fosse 8,
where they hung on, though reduced to the strength of a single battalion.</p>

<p>"The heroism of the pipers was splendid. In spite of murderous fire
they continued playing. At one moment, when the fire of the machine guns
was so terrific that it looked as if the attack must break down, a Seaforth
piper dashed forward in front of the line and started 'Caber Feidh.' The
effect was instantaneous&mdash;the sorely pressed men braced themselves together
and charged forward. The Germans soon got to realise the value of the
pipes and tried to pick off the pipers."</p>

<p>In this one attack the 5th Camerons had three pipers killed and eight
wounded. Further south the pipers of the 2nd and 6th Gordons led their
companies in the costly attack on Hulluch and the Quarries. An officer
of the Devons, on their flank, writes:</p>

<p>"I shall never forget those pipes.... During the charge a Gordon piper
continued playing after he was down."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other side of the Hulluch road the 15th Division received its
baptism of fire, and lost 6000 men in the two days' fighting. One of the
battalions of the 46th Brigade, the 7th King's Own Scottish Borderers,
afforded an admirable example of the value of the pipes in rallying men
when the position is critical. The piper concerned, Daniel Laidlaw, was
awarded the Victoria Cross and the Croix de Guerre. The <cite>London Gazette</cite>
Notification, which does not err on the side of uncontrolled emotionalism,
describes the award as follows:</p>

<p>"For most conspicuous bravery.... During the worst of the bombardment,
when the attack was about to commence, Piper Laidlaw, seeing that
his company was somewhat shaken from the effects of gas, with absolute
coolness and disregard of danger, mounted the parapet, marched up and
down and played his company out of the trench. The effect of his splendid
example was immediate, and the company dashed out to the assault. Piper
Laidlaw continued playing his pipes until he was wounded."</p>

<p>The evidence of eye-witnesses shows that, at the time, a cloud of gas
was settling down on the trench and there was heavy machine-gun fire.
Laidlaw played "Blue Bonnets over the Border," and the effect on the
men was indescribable; as they followed him over the top he changed
to "The Standard on the Braes of Mar." The old tune was surely never
played to better purpose; and if Laidlaw's action stood alone, if he were
the only piper during the war who stimulated a company at the moment
when things were at their worst, surely that achievement amply supports
the view that, even in the warfare of to-day, <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">piob mhor</i> is an instrument of
war which can justify all claims made for it. As it is, Piper Laidlaw, "the
Piper of Loos," stands as type of a class of men who, throughout the war,
have lived up to the traditions of a great past.</p>

<p>Another piper of the same battalion, Douglas Taylor, being wounded
and unable to play, spent thirty-six hours bringing in gassed men without
relief, until he himself was dangerously wounded. Further on, the 44th
Brigade&mdash;the 8th Seaforths, 7th Camerons, 9th Black Watch and 10th
Gordons&mdash;made the historic charge which captured Loos and then went
on, until, for want of support, they could get no further and were compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
to retire. They rallied on Hill 70 round a tattered flag made out of a
Cameron kilt. The battalions of this brigade were played into and beyond
Loos; and, when they were widely scattered and mixed up, pipers played to
rally the men of their own battalions. Among many others, Piper Charles
Cameron of the 11th Argylls stood out in the open playing unconcernedly,
and was thereafter known in his battalion as "the Piper of Loos."</p>

<p>The shattered remnants of the 15th Division were withdrawn in the
evening from the blood-stained slopes of Hill 70, but the battalions were
played in by their own pipers. The 9th Black Watch numbered only 100
of all ranks and one piper; the 7th Cameron pipers were practically annihilated,
the 8th Seaforths lost ten, and others suffered in similar degree.</p>

<p>It is a far cry from Hill 70 to Scaur Donald, and they were only regimental
pipers, but to these brave men the words of the old song are surely

<p>In the fighting subsidiary to the main action of Loos, at Mauquissart
and in the neighbourhood of Neuve Chapelle, the 2nd Black Watch pipers
distinguished themselves greatly. They played their companies into and
beyond the first line of German trenches. One of them, A. Macdonald,
stood playing on the German parapet while the position was being cleared,
and then on, through a hurricane of fire, over three lines of trenches, until
dangerously wounded. For this he was given the D.C.M.</p>

<p>Three others, J. Galloway, R. Johnstone and David Armit, did precisely
the same; and yet another, David Simpson, behaved with such gallantry
that he also came to be known as "the Piper of Loos," the third of the
brave trio to earn that honourable title. He had already played over
three lines of German trenches, and was leading towards the fourth when
he was killed. Johnstone, on this occasion, played till he fell gassed.</p>

<p>Throughout the long succession of actions which punctuated the Somme
operations in 1916, the pipes continued to be much in evidence, and refer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>ences
to them and to their effect upon the men during that bloody fighting
are frequent in the contemporary reports of observers, and in private letters
subsequently published. French reports also have placed on record their
admiration for the company pipers of Scottish regiments. "Some of the
finest work," writes one well-known French military writer, "was accomplished
at the very outset by the Highlanders, who carried the trenches
in lightning fashion, urged on by the inspiriting music of their pipes."</p>

<p>The fighting at Loos had shown, on a comparatively small scale, that
the pipes, when freed from the restrictions placed upon their employment
by the exigencies of trench warfare, were still capable of fulfilling their
historic <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i> in open fighting The gallantry of the pipers at Hulluch and
Hill 70 was worthy of the units they led, and established a record which
was hard to beat; but for months on end their great achievements were
emulated by those of their successors in the new armies which had poured
into the field.</p>

<p>The opening attack on the 1st July affords numerous examples of pipers
playing their companies into action, and a few may be taken as representative
of the whole.</p>

<p>In the attack by the 32nd Division the 17th H.L.I, succeeded, with a loss
of over 500 men, in capturing and holding part of the Leipzig redoubt, though
unsupported for a considerable time. The Commanding Officer writes:</p>

<p>"I told the Pipe Major to play; he at once responded, getting into a
small hollow, and playing and greatly heartening the men as they lay there
hanging on to the captured position. Pipe Major Gilbert showed a total
disregard of danger and played as if he were on a route march. For this
action he obtained the Military Medal."</p>

<p>In the advance on Mametz on the same day the 2nd Gordons were led
by their company pipers. An officer of an English battalion in the 20th
Brigade describes how "we heard their pipes play these fellows over. It
sounded grand against the noise of shells, machine guns and rifle fire. I
shall never forget them."</p>

<p>The same thing occurred later when the battalion attacked the orchards
of Ginchy. On both occasions the casualties were very heavy.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>At Fricourt Pipe Major David Anderson of the 15th Royal Scots stood
out in front of the battalion until he was wounded, and played across
shell-beaten ground under heavy fire. He was awarded the Croix de
Guerre.</p>

<p>The two battalions of Tyneside Scottish were similarly played to their
attack on La Boiselle and the ridge in front of it on the opening day of the
battle of the Somme. A correspondent who was present says:</p>

<p>"The Tynesiders were on our right, and, as they got the signal to advance,
I saw a piper&mdash;I think he was the Pipe Major&mdash;jump out of the trench and
march straight towards the German lines. The tremendous rattle of machine-gun
and rifle fire completely drowned the sound of his pipes, but he was
obviously playing as though he would burst the bag, and, faintly through
the roar of battle, we heard the mighty cheer his comrades gave as they
swarmed after him. How he escaped I can't understand, for the ground
was literally ploughed up by the hail of bullets; but he bore a charmed
life, and the last glimpse I had of him as we, too, dashed out showed him
still marching erect, playing on regardless of the flying bullets and of the
men dropping all round him."</p>

<p>Of the two battalions 10 pipers were killed and 5 wounded, and Pipe
Major Wilson and Piper G. Taylor both got the Military Medal. Many
of these pipers, having played their companies up to the German trenches,
took an active part in the fighting as bombers.</p>

<p>Again, at Longueval on 14th July, regimental pipers were conspicuous.
As the 26th Brigade&mdash;8th Black Watch, 10th Argylls, 9th Seaforths, and
5th Camerons&mdash;commenced their advance, they were exposed to frontal
and enfilading machine-gun fire, and shrapnel mowed them down; but
their pipers led the way, and the men followed cheering and shouting.</p>

<p>"Where we were the brunt of the action fell on two New Army battalions
of historic Highland regiments. Their advance was one of the most magnificent
sights I have ever seen. They left their trenches at dawn, and a torrent
of bullets met them. They answered immediately&mdash;with the shrill music
of the pipes, and, indifferent apparently to the chaos around them, pushed
steadily on towards their objective."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Describing the attack by the 10th Argylls, another observer writes:</p>

<p>"We came under a blistering hot fire, but the men never hesitated. In
the middle of it all the pipes struck up "The Campbells are coming," and
that made victory a certainty for us. We felt that whatever obstacles
there barred our path they had to be overcome.... The last fight was
the worst of all. It was at the extreme end of the village, where the enemy
had possession of some ruined houses. They had a clear line of fire in all
directions, and we were met with a murderous hail of fire. For a moment
the men wavered. I doubted if they were equal to it. Then a piper sprang
forward, and the strains broke out once more. The attacking line steadied
and dashed at the last stronghold of the Huns. Their line snapped under
our onslaught."</p>

<p>On this occasion the Pipe Major, Aitken, a man of sixty, was awarded
the Distinguished Conduct Medal. One of the pipers referred to in the
above incident was James Dall, and his Commanding Officer considers
his action in playing the regimental march at this juncture was the means
of his company gaining their objective; the other was D. Wilson, who
was also mentioned in despatches with Dall.</p>

<p>Of the attack by the 9th Seaforths a wounded officer writes:</p>

<p>"We swept on until we finally carried the German trench with a rousing
cheer to the strain of the pipes. The heroism of the pipers was splendid.
In spite of murderous fire they kept playing on. At one moment, when the
fire was so terrific it looked as if the attack must break down, one of the
pipers dashed forward and started playing. The change could be felt at
once, the sorely pressed men gave a mighty cheer and dashed forward
with new zeal."</p>

<p>North of Longueval the 1st Gordons made a furious attack, on the 18th
July, and on this occasion they were led by their pipers.</p>

<p>"They were out of sight over the parapet, but we could hear at intervals
their shouts of 'Scotland for ever!' and the faint strains of the pipes. Then
we saw them reappear, and then came prisoners."</p>

<p>Similar accounts were given of the 6th and 7th Gordons. In the 6th
Gordons Piper Charles Thomson had his arm blown off while playing. "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
gallantry of these men who wear the tartans of the old Scottish clans would
seem wonderful if it were not habitual with them. Their first dash for
Longueval was one of the finest exploits of the war. They were led forward
by the pipers, who went with them, not only towards the German lines,
but across them and into the thick of the battle.... In that September
fighting the pipe major of a Gordon battalion played his men forward and
then was struck below the knee; but he would not be touched by a doctor
until the others had been tended. He was a giant of a man and so heavy
that no stretcher could hold him, so they put him in a tarpaulin and carried
him back. Then he had his leg amputated and died."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>On the 3rd September the 4th Black Watch were played into action
and had to capture a village. According to an eye-witness:</p>

<p>"It was magnificent to see these men charge up the narrow street leading
to the second barricade. Amid the ruined houses on each side the enemy
were posted. At the moment when it was hottest the strains of the pipes
were heard. The men answered with a cheer and swept steadily on over
the barricade and through the ruins; and the village was ours."</p>

<p>Of a Seaforth battalion a similar story is told:</p>

<p>"The men simply raced into the storm of bullets ... at last it became
too terrible for any human being to stand against it. The attacking lines
melted away, the men seeking what cover could be found.... It was
here that the pipers of the Seaforths had their chance. They took it.
As the men advanced again to the attack they were cheered on by the
strains of the pipes, which could just be heard. The men dashed through,
clearing out the enemy as they went."</p>

<p>During the attack on Beaumont Hamel in October, as in the earlier
fighting at Thiepval, the pipers of the 15th H.L.I. lost very heavily when
leading their companies.</p>

<p>Such instances of the bravery of pipers and of the stimulus afforded
by the pipes to men in action became matters of almost every-day occurrence,
and, though everyone recognised the tremendous losses that were the
result of their exposure, there were occasions when those losses were more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
than compensated for at the time by the results obtained. Everywhere,
at Contalmaison, Martinpuich, Pozières, Delville Wood, wherever Scottish
troops were employed, their pipers played their historic <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i>, and, to quote
Philip Gibbs, "over the open battlefields came the music of the Scottish
pipes, shrill above the noise of gunfire."</p>

<p>Nor were the pipers of purely Scottish regiments left to establish these
records of bravery unchallenged. They had keen rivals in battalions of
overseas Scots, notably the South African Scottish and the Canadians.</p>

<p>During the fighting for Delville Wood in July the South Africans were
torn to pieces by shell fire. The remains of the battalion hung on for
days, losing all their officers but the colonel. When relief came their
pipers headed the blackened and weary warriors out of the wood of
death.</p>

<p>Similarly, the 16th Canadian Scottish pipers maintained the fine reputation
they had earned on the Ypres salient. When the battalion moved up
to the attack on the Regina trench on 8th October, there was keen competition
among the pipers as to who should be allowed to play them over.
"Four pipers, Richardson, Park, M'Kellar and Paul marched ahead of the
battalion with the Commanding Officer for a distance of half a mile under
intense machine-gun fire and escaped scatheless. They could be heard
clearly as they played 'We'll take the good old way,' and, as they passed,
wounded men lying in shell holes raised themselves on their elbows and
cheered them. When they got near the German line the battalion encountered
uncut wire which, being unusually heavy, took some time to cut. While
this was going on Piper Richardson played up and down outside the wire
for twenty minutes in the face of almost certain death.... Shortly afterwards
a company sergeant major was wounded, and Richardson volunteered
to take him out. After he had gone he remembered he had left his pipes
behind. He left the sergeant major in safety in a shell hole and returned.
He was never heard of again."</p>

<p>This brave man was awarded a posthumous V.C., the second piper to
obtain this coveted distinction. Piper Paul was subsequently given the
Military Medal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>At the capture of the Vimy Ridge on 9th April, 1917, by the Canadians,
the pipers of some of their battalions took a prominent part. On this
occasion the 16th Canadian Scottish repeated what they had done in previous
engagements, their companies being led by pipers. The pipers concerned
were Pipe Major Groat and Pipers M'Gillivray, M'Nab, M'Allister, M'Kellar
and Paul, and they advanced a distance of over a mile under heavy fire
without any casualties. The Pipe Major was awarded the Military Medal.</p>

<p>Similarly the 25th Canadians had their pipers out in this action, and
Piper Walter Telfer, who went on playing after being severely wounded,
was given the Military Medal; Piper Brand got the same decoration.</p>

<p>Later on, in the fighting round Arras, a battalion of the Camerons was
played to the attack:</p>

<p>"When the order came our men went over with right good will. It
was a thrilling moment, especially when the pipes struck up the Camerons'
march. I believe it was that music, at that particular moment, which made
it possible for us to go through the ordeal that followed."</p>

<p>Once again "The March of the Cameron Men" was the undoing of
an enemy which had to stand up against the Camerons; and in one part
of the line, when the attack was most furiously resisted, the company piper
changed his tune to the old "Piobaireachd Dhomnuil Duibh"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Fast they came, fast they come,</p>
<p class="verse">See how they gather!</p>
<p class="verse">Wide waves the eagle's plume</p>
<p class="verse">Blended with heather."</p>
</div></div>

<p>An account of the few minutes before "zero" by a piper of this battalion
appeared in the <cite>Scottish Field</cite> ("Pipes of the Misty Moorland," John
M'Gibbon), and affords a good example of the steadying effect of the pipes
in a period of great strain on morale:</p>

<p>"I looked down at the company and I could see they were shaken....
I slung my rifle over my back and took up the pipes; that cheered them.
I played through two or three tunes and then birled up 'Tullochgorum.'
They fairly hooched it and stamped time with their feet. It was close
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>on 'zero' ... when I changed to 'The March of The Cameron Men.' Our
guns burst out with drum fire behind us ... and the men jumped the parapet
like deer and raced over the broken ground at the double. I kept up 'The
Cameron Men.' ... I reached the parapet of the first enemy trench, when
I 'stopped one' with my leg, and down I went in a heap."</p>

<p>The pipes were again to the front in the fighting for Hill 70 on the Lens-Loos
line in August, 1917. It was surely appropriate enough that, in the
advance over the very country in which so many Scottish regiments had
fought, with only temporary success, two years before, the pipes should again
be at the head of the units which recaptured those blood-soaked positions.</p>

<p>An officer, describing the advance of the 13th Royal Highlanders of
Canada, says:</p>

<p>"Our advance was resumed and we swarmed over the top at three
different points. Away to the left, which was the objective of our advance,
the strains of the pipes could be heard, and across the hills, where so many
Scottish lads had fallen two years ago, there burst a loud triumphant cheer
as the Canadian Highlanders pressed on to complete their work."</p>

<p>And so it happened that the gallant lads of the 15th Division were
avenged.</p>

<p>Opportunities for pipers continued during the later fighting in 1917-18.
Records of individual companies and platoons show that on several occasions
the pipes encouraged the men to further effort. In one case near Albert,
a company of the Black Watch was temporarily cut off from its supports
after getting into a German trench and suffered heavily; the men were
crushed by superior numbers, and the prospect was black until the piper,
who was present as a stretcher bearer, started playing. This had a great effect
on the company, which held on to the position until reinforcements arrived.</p>

<p>In the fighting about Albert in August, 1918, several instances occurred
of pipers playing their companies to the attack.</p>

<p>On the whole, however, at this stage in the war, it was being found
increasingly difficult to renew the depleted ranks of the pipe bands, and most
regiments were simply driven to keeping their pipers out of action as far
as possible, except on special occasions. But there were still enough left of
them to lead their units ever further eastward as the tide of war rolled back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Incidents frequently occurred showing that their experience of four
years' fighting had not damped the ardour of pipers in action.</p>

<p>On one occasion a 16th Canadian piper went into action playing on
top of a tank, and was killed. At Amiens, the pipers of the 16th and
48th Highlanders of Canada played the battalions to the attack in
August, 1918.</p>

<p>As the German defeat became increasingly apparent and the British
forces drove the enemy before them, pipers again got an opportunity of
leading their companies to the attack. During the fighting about Albert-Arras
in August, 1918, Scottish troops were heavily engaged. Lieut.
Edouard Ross, of the French interpreter staff, describes an attack by a
battalion of the Black Watch in which a detachment with a piper got into
the German trenches; they were all wounded, and their position was
dangerous, but the piper started playing, and the sound rapidly brought
reinforcements, who captured the position.</p>


<h3>GALLIPOLI</h3>

<p>In Gallipoli, as on the Western front, pipers added lustre to their reputation;
and incidents which occurred to some of them showed that they were
stout fighting men even after their pipes were put out of action.</p>

<p>The nature of the terrain generally precluded the more spectacular duty
of playing their units to the attack, and the heavy casualties in the force
and the constant demand for men resulted in their being frequently
employed in the ranks; nevertheless, several cases did occur of company
pipers acting as such.</p>

<p>On 12th July, 1916, when the 6th H.L.I. captured three lines of Turkish
trenches, Pipers W. Mackenzie and M'Niven played at the head of their
companies; M'Niven was killed, and Mackenzie, putting down his pipes,
took part in the fighting with a Turkish shovel and did great execution.</p>

<p>On the same day the pipers of the 7th H.L.I. led their battalion into
action, and only one of them was wounded. Of these men one, Piper
Kenneth MacLennan, was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Medal "for playing his pipes during the attack and advancing with the
line after his pipes had been shattered by shrapnel, and heartening the
wounded under fire." Another, Piper Cameron, played his company over
three lines of trenches, with a revolver hanging on his wrist, and earned
a mention in despatches; and Piper Macfarlane played through two bayonet
charges until two of his drones were blown off by shell fragments.</p>

<p>Writing of the fighting on 12th July, a wounded officer writes:</p>

<p>"The sound of the pipes undoubtedly stirred them on, a piper belonging
to each of the two battalions, 5th Argylls and 7th H.L.I., having mounted
the parapets of their own trenches, and there in full danger played their
comrades on to victory."</p>

<p>In the attack on Achi Baba there was no opportunity for pipers as
such, though Pipe Major Andrew Buchan played the 4th Royal Scots "over
the top," and, as an officer writes: "fearless of all danger went along the
line and did much to hearten the men." Buchan was killed.</p>

<p>Of the pipers of the 5th Royal Scots none survived the early days of the
fighting on the Peninsula. An officer of the regiment wrote that they
"gloriously upheld the traditions established long ago." In the Achi Baba
fighting four were killed and four wounded.</p>

<p>Casualties in action and by disease took heavy toll of the pipers of all
these battalions, and after a few months on the Peninsula the pipe bands
temporarily ceased to exist.</p>

<p>Even before the withdrawal of the force from Gallipoli it was found
that so many casualties had occurred among the pipers of the battalions
engaged that the bands were well on the way to extinction. Consequently,
under the able management of Colonel Maclean of Pennycross a divisional
band numbering twelve pipers and six drummers&mdash;all that remained&mdash;was
organised out of the wreck of the pipe bands of the 52nd Division.
That band, though never sent into action, individually or collectively
played frequently under shell fire; and "Hey Johnnie Cope" could be
heard quite distinctly every morning in the firing line up to within a few
days of the evacuation.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The divisional band served on the Desert front in Egypt, and then
accompanied the Division right into Palestine, playing the leading battalion,
the 4th K.O.S.B.'s, over the frontier to "Blue Bonnets over the Border."</p>

<p>Later on, more pipers and more Scottish units appeared; and so we
find the 2nd London Scottish being played into Jerusalem, and "Dumbarton's
Drums" sounding at the head of the Royal Scots as they took over the
guard on the Holy Sepulchre&mdash;as is the right of "Pontius Pilate's Bodyguard."</p>


<h3>SALONIKA</h3>

<p>Opportunities for the employment of pipers as such were comparatively
rare in the course of the Salonika operations, for obvious reasons. At
Karadzakot Zir, however, the 1st Royal Scots pipers played their companies
to the attack on the village, and the C.O. reported that, in his opinion,</p>

<p>"It was largely due to the presence of the pipers with the leading wave
that the enemy evacuated their trenches and retired in disorder."</p>


<h3>MESOPOTAMIA</h3>

<p>Playing the pipes in the Golden East is a far greater effort than it is
at home, and every piper who has soldiered there knows how the heat
and the dryness of the atmosphere affect his bag and reeds. But the cult
of <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">piob mhor</i> thrives east of Suez, and at least as much enthusiasm is shown
by regiments stationed in India as in a home station.</p>

<p>And when Scottish troops were called upon to take their part in the
Mesopotamia operations, we find the pipes as prominent a feature in the
fighting as they were on the Western front. At Sheikh Saad on 7th January,
1916, the 1st Seaforths&mdash;the "Reismeid Caber Feidh"&mdash;were played to the
attack across absolutely open ground by their Pipe Major Neil M'Kechnie
and other pipers. An officer who was present describes the incident as
follows:</p>

<p>"As we advanced over the dead flat open desert the Turks suddenly
opened a very heavy fire from well concealed trenches at a range of from
600 to 800 yards. The battalion immediately advanced by rushes towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the enemy's position in spite of very heavy initial losses. Foremost among
the men was our acting Pipe Major, M'Kechnie, who immediately struck
up the regimental charge or 'onset,' 'Cabar Feidh.'</p>

<p>"His fine example as well as his music had a remarkable effect on the
men at such a critical moment. He was shortly afterwards wounded, and
had to drop behind as the lines went on."</p>

<p>In the same action the 2nd Black Watch were played in by their pipers
just as they had been on many previous occasions in France. In the act
of playing Corpl. Piper MacNee was mortally wounded. This brave man
had been wounded before at Mauquissart and awarded the Distinguished
Conduct Medal. The Pipe Major, John Keith, was awarded the D.C.M.
for "gallant and distinguished service throughout the operations."</p>


<h3>THE LAST STAGE</h3>

<p>For four years and a half the pipes of war played their part in the greatest
war in history; in the front, under conditions in which they could never
have been expected to exist at all, they have led men to victory, have rallied
them when victory eluded their grasp, and have marched them back undismayed
by the tortures of battle; behind the lines they have headed
the long columns of Scottish troops on their way up to the furnace in which
the fate of nations was cast.</p>

<p>But, everywhere, they expressed the ideal of the race and led men to
follow causes, even causes which appeared lost ones, through to the end.</p>

<p>When silence fell on the 11th November, 1918, along the blasted line
where rival civilisations had so long struggled for mastery, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i> of the
pipes changed, and it was no longer the "onset" that the piper was impelled
to play. The consummation of long effort had been attained&mdash;and what
instrument more entitled to bear witness to the fact than the one which
had sounded over the blood-stained slag-heaps of Loos, the shell-swept
heights of Vimy?</p>

<p>As the British First Army entered Valenciennes, the pipers of a historic
Scottish division played through the "place" opposite the Hotel de Ville,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and must have awakened in the old gabled houses memories of the centuries
old alliance between the Lilies of France and the Thistle.</p>

<p>Further east, along the roads that led to Cologne, the pipes played
unceasingly, as befitted the occasion, impressing on the population that
this was indeed the coming of "Scotland the Brave."</p>

<p>And so, over the great Rhine bridge, the pipes of the 9th and Canadian
Divisions led the way, and Germany learnt at last that when <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">piob mhor</i>
sounds "<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Gabhaidh sin an rathad mor</span>"<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> it generally attains its objective.</p>


<h3>PIPERS IN THE RANKS</h3>

<p>The piper is, first and last, a fighting man; and when a regiment is
mobilised it at once loses most of its pipers. Whatever the strength of
the band may have been in peace time, only the "sergeant piper"&mdash;a hideous
official term for the pipe major&mdash;and five "full" pipers are normally retained
as such. The remainder, while acting as pipers when opportunity offers&mdash;and
designated accordingly&mdash;serve in the ranks.</p>

<p>During this war, and notably during the early years of it, it was often
found necessary to make use of full and acting pipers in some purely military
capacity, <em>i.e.</em> either in the ranks, or as Lewis gunners, bombers, orderlies,
runners or stretcher bearers. This fact accounts for many of the honours
awarded to pipers, and, at the same time, for the heavy casualties among
them.</p>

<p>It is quite impossible to do justice to individuals or units in regard
to the part they played in performing such duties; for those who obtained
official recognition, in some form or other, hundreds have merely had the
satisfaction of playing the game, in accordance with the rules laid down
by all ranks of the British army. The few examples given in this place
are typical of the whole.</p>

<p>At Festubert in June, 1915, the pipers of the 6th Seaforths worked
continuously day and night, and brought 170 casualties from the front
line to the dressing station; at Loos the 9th Black Watch lost nearly all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
their pipers when similarly engaged, and at the two actions of Loos and
Neuve Chapelle the 6th Gordons had two killed and ten wounded.</p>

<p>Again, the 2nd Royal Scots pipers lost heavily on the Somme, and
were on one occasion highly commended for bringing water up to some
newly captured trenches under heavy fire.</p>

<p>The comments of General Sir William Birdwood in a despatch to the
Australian Government, though intended to apply to Australian stretcher
bearers, are very applicable to pipers acting in this capacity, whether
individually or collectively:</p>

<p>"Where all have done so well it is very hard to differentiate, but as
a class the stretcher bearers have been beyond praise. Never for a second
have they flinched from going forward time after time, absolutely regardless
of the fire brought against them; and I so deeply regret that they should
have suffered in consequence."</p>

<p>Another and most hazardous class of duty, which was largely performed
by pipers in some battalions, was that of "runners" or despatch carriers;
this often involved crossing heavily shelled country, and has resulted in
many casualties. Notable cases have occurred of men carrying despatches
through intense barrages, and some have received rewards; the majority
of such cases, however, have necessarily been unnoticed.</p>

<p>Some men appear to have specialised in this duty, <em>e.g.</em> Pipe Major Matheson,
1st Seaforths, who got the D.C.M. "for gallant conduct on many
occasions in conveying messages under heavy fire," and Lance-Corpl. Piper
Dyce, 13th Royal Highlanders of Canada, who on one occasion carried
a most urgent despatch through artillery barrage when badly wounded.</p>

<p>In other cases pipers, individually and collectively, have done admirable
service in bringing up ammunition.</p>

<p>Many instances of acts of heroism by individual men are detailed below.</p>

<h3>PIPERS ON THE MARCH</h3>

<p>Playing the pipes in action, though essentially the most important,
is, for obvious reasons, only one of the duties of the soldier piper. Every
unit of an army is not always in close touch with the enemy, and every
battalion puts in a good many miles of marching in a year in conditions
which are rarely ideal and very often acutely miserable. It is here that
the pipes have rendered such conspicuous service as the marching instrument
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>; and the cult of the bagpipe has spread to units and nationalities
which, before the war, would never have thought it possible that
the company piper would become one of their most cherished institutions.</p>

<p>That Irish regiments should again adopt the national instrument that
had played their ancestors on to the battlefields of France in 1286 is so
natural as to need no comment; but when we find English and Australian
units, battalions of the United States army, and ships of His Majesty's
Navy, to say nothing of field ambulances and transport units, adopting
the bagpipe, no further evidence is required to substantiate its claim to
be a highly important feature of modern military organisation.</p>

<p>It is indeed to a recognition, in the very early days of the war, of the
great value of the pipes in "exciting alacrity and cheerfulness in the soldier"
that is due the fact that so many units have deliberately tried to keep
their pipers out of harm's way, and have only allowed them, under protest,
to accompany their companies into action, and then only in limited numbers.
Commanding officers have appreciated that, as a stimulus to tired men,
to men marching weary miles to take up a position, to men returning worn
out from a spell of duty, the music of the pipes has proved invaluable.</p>

<p>Instances of this stimulating effect are too numerous to mention, but
a few, taken from contemporary accounts of the war, may be regarded
as typical.</p>

<p>The following incident in the retirement from Mons has frequently
occurred elsewhere. "I shall never forget how one General saw a batch
of Gordons and K.O.S.B. stragglers trudging listlessly along the road. He
halted them. Some more came up, until there was about a company in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
all, with one piper. He made them form fours, put the piper at the head
of them, 'Now lads, follow the piper and remember Scotland,' and they
all started off as pleased as Punch, with the tired piper playing like a hero."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Maclean, C.M.G., describes a case of the effect of the pipes
on tired men:</p>

<p>"It was a sweltering hot day, and the road was deep with dust. The
long snaky khaki column came marching steadily down the hill, silent
under the weight of their accoutrements with the grinding heat of an April
sun.... As the Scots came by he gave the sign to the piper. He stepped
forward and struck up one of the great battle marches of our race. The
scene that followed baffled description. A roar of cheering burst from
the ranks."</p>

<p>Another instance,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> by one who was himself in the ranks, may be regarded
as typical. The regiment concerned was the Glasgow Highlanders, but
the description is applicable to every Scottish regiment in the Army List:</p>

<p>"Kilometre after kilometre we marched, through the hottest hours
of the middle day, and our feet and backs ached under the weight of all
we carried, our faces were dabbled and streaked with dust and perspiration,
and in our mouths was only dust to chew....</p>

<p>"Walking had become a purely mechanical exercise, our limbs controlled,
as it seemed, by some power outwith us; our brains were numb and dazed
with fatigue and the maddening persisting pain that was our every step.
Blindly, dumbly, helplessly we staggered on ... in infinite weariness we
dragged ourselves to the beginning of the street, and then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then the pipes suddenly set the heavens and the earth dancing to
the strains of 'Highland Laddie,' the regimental march of the Glasgows.
And at the skirl of the pipes, and before the eyes of those critical spectators,
every man braced himself, his step assumed as much of jauntiness as he
could put into it, and he had a laugh and a jesting answer ready on his
lips for every outsider who spoke to him.... It was something more
potent than wine that put the boldness into their step, it was the sense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>of the tradition and honour of their regiment: the feeling that on no account
must they present other than a brave front to the world, that the one
unpardonable offence would be to let the battalion down."</p>

<p>Examples could be multiplied indefinitely, but the best tribute to the
value of the pipes as a marching instrument and in keeping the men cheery
is, after all, the fact that regiment after regiment felt constrained to keep
them out of action entirely&mdash;whether as pipers pure and simple or in other
military capacities.</p>

<p>Statements to this effect have been received from nearly all the regiments
whose views have been asked, commanding officers being almost unanimous
in their opinion that, only where it is imperatively necessary, should a
pipe band be exposed to the chances of annihilation inseparable from modern
shell fire.</p>

<p>And in just the same manner as the pipes have helped battalions along
the "via dolorosa" into action so they have, time and again, played them
back to rest and comparative security. In some cases they had shared in
the action itself, in others they waited until their services were required.
Many commanding officers and observers have referred to this as one of
the most important of their duties. In describing the return of a battalion,
or what remained of it, from Longueval, Philip Gibbs writes:</p>

<p>"There was a thick summer haze about, and on the ridges the black
vapours of shell bursts.... It was out of this that the Highlanders came
marching. They brought the music with them and the pipes of war playing
a Scottish love song, 'I lo'e na a laddie but ane.' Their kilts were caked
with mud, they were very tired, but they held their heads up, and the
pipers who had been with them played bravely ... and the Scottish love
song rang out across the fields."</p>

<p>An officer of an Argyll battalion, writing of the days of trench fighting,
says: "They have done much to hearten us on long marches. They came out
of Bethune after Loos and played what was left of us back to billets."
Another, in the Royal Scots, referring to the return of the battalion from
Kemmel, says: "I shall never forget the effect on the men; as they struck
up they fairly shouted themselves hoarse with delight."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wonderful pipes! The men get tired and would fall out, but the
pipes make a unity of them. Invisible tendons and muscles seem to connect
the legs of all files, and all move as one, mechanically, rhythmically, certainly.
The strong are reduced to the step, the weak are braced up to it. All bear
the strain and share the strain. So we go on, and the miracle is in the
power of the music."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>A final quotation&mdash;one of a very great number received&mdash;reflects the
opinion of all ranks:</p>

<p>"I have often seen a company just out of the trenches straggling along
the road too weary to think of keeping in formation, let alone in step. On
the first sound of the pipes these same men would double up to their place
and march along with the best of them."</p>

<p>The ubiquity of the pipes on the Western front has been remarked
by all observers. "The music of the pipes is now as much a part of the
great orchestra of this war as the incessant rumbling of distant guns, as
the swirl of traffic along the transport lines, as the singing of birds above
No Man's Land.... And where there are pipes there are Scotsmen&mdash;Scots
everywhere from the sea to St. Quentin, in old French market towns,
and in Flemish villages ... and in camps behind the fighting line not beyond
the reach of long range shells, and up in the trenches where death is very
near to them.... As long as history lasts the spirit of France will salute
the memory of these kilted boys and of all the Lowland Scots who have
gone into the furnace fires of this war to the music of the pipes, and have
fallen in heaps upon her fields. A thousand years hence, when the wind
blows softly across the ground where they fought, old Scottish tunes will
sound faintly in the ears of men who remember the past, and all this country
will be haunted with the ghosts of Scotland's gallant sons."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Nor has it been on the Western front alone that the value of the pipes
has made itself appreciated. In every other theatre of war as well has
"the tune with the tartan of the clan in it" been heard at the head of
columns toiling through the dust and heat, or through pitiless rain. In
Egypt and Gallipoli and the Holy Land, in Mesopotamia and the Balkans,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>the pipes have been the prelude to great happenings. "Bundle and Go"
in the early dawn of an Eastern day, "Soldier lie down" at night&mdash;these
have been the preliminaries which led up naturally to "Cabar Feidh" in
a hail of machine gun fire, or "Horo mo nighean donn bhoidheach" in the
streets of captured Bagdad.</p>

<p>"Many a soldier sadly misses his pipe, which of course may not be lit
on a night march; but to me a greater loss is the silence of those other
pipes, for the sound of the bagpipes will stir up a thousand memories in
a Highland regiment, and nothing helps a column of weary foot soldiers so
well as pipe music, backed by the beat of a drum."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>When the British army advanced into German territory the pipers
had an opportunity to play with an abandon that had never been felt
before.</p>

<p>"Next day, with the skies still streaming, we made the longest continuous
march, some 36 kilometres, and by that effort got well into Germany. The
roads improved as we got farther on, but the tramp through the forest of
Zitter was long, marshy, and melancholy. Our company was first after the
pipers, and had the full benefit of the music all the way. And we wandered
inward; inward, with our seeking and haunting Gaelic melodies, into the
depths of the hanging, silent wood. It was strange how aloof nature seemed
to these melodies. In Scotland, or even in France, all the hills and the
woods would have helped the music. But in this German land all were cold
toward us, and those endless pine trees seemed to be holding hands with
fingers spread before the eyes to show their shame and humiliation. There
was a curious sense that the road on which we trod was not our road, and that
earth and her fruits on either hand were hostile.</p>

<p>"And how tired the men became, with half of them through the soles
of their boots and with racking damp in their shoulders and backs from their
rain-sodden packs. But we listened still whilst voluminous waves of melody
wandered homeless over German wastes and returned to us,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">I heard the pibroch sounding, sounding,</p>
<p class="verse">O'er the wide meadows and lands from afar.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">or to the stirring strains of the 'March of the Battle of Harlaw,' or to the
crooning, hoping, sobbing of 'Lord Lovat's Lament,' and so went on from
hour to hour through the emptiness of Southern Germany. When we thought
we had just about reached our camping ground for the night, we came to a
guide post which showed it still to be seven kilometres on. But that was
at the top of a long hill, and the road ran gently down through woods the
whole way. The colonel sent a message to play 'Men of Portree.' The
rain had stopped, and an evening sky unveiled a more cheerful light. So,
with an easy inconsequent air, we cast off care and tripped away down to
the substantial and prosperous bit of Rhineland called Hellenthal, well on
our way to Cologne."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The interminable marches are over and their goal has been attained;
and the instrument which has a tune for every human emotion can now
play "The Desperate Battle" in German towns with a safety which has
been long unknown. To many a man, however, as he fingers his chanter,
the feeling will come, as he thinks of the good men and true who never
reached the 11th November, 1918, that the tune that is most appropriate
is "Lochaber no more."</p>


<h3>PIPE TUNES</h3>

<p>Pipe tunes&mdash;as every piper knows&mdash;have local associations, associations
with particular incidents, particular emotions; and in military piping
this is never overlooked. In war everything has changed&mdash;everything
but the elemental courage and passions of the men who are engaged in it;
and, as <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">piob mhor</i> is essentially the instrument on which those elemental
passions can be best expressed, it is not uninteresting to observe how
individual pipers have resorted to particular tunes, to suit particular
occasions. In many, perhaps in most, cases there were traditional or regimental
reasons for playing one tune rather than another, and such tunes
were often in the highest degree appropriate; but in other cases the
individuality of the performer determined the choice.</p>

<p>Of a selection based on tradition the best authenticated instance is
that of the Gordon piper who played Cogadh na Sith, "War or peace,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
during the Somme fighting. The tune itself, a piobaireachd composed
by the great M'Crimmon some 400 years ago, was played by the Gordons
at Waterloo and by a Cameron piper, Kenneth M'Kay, at Quatre Bras.</p>

<p>"<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>About the middle of June a draft of about a hundred and twenty men
arrived in camp for the Gordons&mdash;the finest draft the commanding officer
declared he had ever seen. On the 18th, they were ordered to the front.
I found they had a piper with them, and immediately laid hold on him
to play the men down to the station. I brought him up to my tent and
provided him with a set of pipes which I had reserved for my own particular
work.... I found something more interesting than that. His great-grandfather
had been a piper in the regiment in the days of the Napoleonic
war, and at the Battle of Waterloo he stood within the square and played
the ancient Highland challenge-march 'Cogadh na Sith,' as the French
cuirassiers hurled themselves upon the immovable ranks in vain.</p>

<p>"'John,' I said, 'this is the anniversary of Waterloo, and you will lead
the men out to that very tune which your great-grandfather played on
that great day.' I told the colonel, and his eyes gleamed as he said to me,
'Ah! padre, we'll do better than that. You will tell the men about it,
and I will call them to attention, and your piper will play his tune in memory
of the men of Waterloo.'</p>

<p>"And so it was done, and a thrilling incident it was as the men stood
rigid and silent in full marching order, and the piper strode proudly along
the ranks, sounding the wild, defiant challenge that stirred the regiment
a hundred years before."</p>

<p>Regimental tunes appeal enormously to the men who hear and know
them; it was probably as much the sound of "Blue Bonnets over the
Border" as the sight of Piper Laidlaw piping along the parapet that made
the men, shaken with shell fire and gas, go straight forward; and red hackles
have followed "Highland Laddie" in circumstances when another tune might
have failed to exert the same extraordinary influence. But, having played
his regulation onset, the piper has an opportunity of suiting his own taste
and selecting a tune appropriate musically and emotionally, as well as
in name, to the occasion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>
<p>On many occasions when the choice of a tune has not been restricted
by regimental custom or tradition, individual performers have made selections
which indicated the remarkable mentality of the British soldier.</p>

<p>At Loos, where Pipers Simpson and M'Donald of the 2nd Black Watch
played their company over the top and through the attack, the tune they
commenced with was "Happy we've been a' thegither,"&mdash;only later changing
into the ceremonial onset "Highland Laddie." To men in a trench who have
suffered untold nerve strain waiting for Zero and who happen&mdash;as do most
men in Highland regiments&mdash;to know one tune from another, no more
appropriate combination of "onsets" could have been selected.</p>

<p>At Beaumont Hamel, when the 17th H.L.I. took the German trenches
and had an opportunity of bombing out the occupants, Pipe Major Gilbert
played another popular and very suitable tune, "The muckin' o' Geordie's
Byre," and greatly encouraged the men in their task. This same tune
has done duty on many similar occasions.</p>

<p>It was to "We'll tak the guid auld way" that the 16th Canadians attacked
at Vimy, and many Cameron pipers have played the "Piobaireachd Dhomhnuill
Duibh" in similar circumstances.</p>

<p>Another very favourite tune was "The Macgregor's Gathering" which
was played with great effect in the capture of many villages during the
Somme fighting.</p>

<p>A curious coincidence was the selection by the pipers of the 1st H.L.I.
of "I'll gang nae mair tae yon toun" as they marched out of Marseilles
on 1st November, 1914, on their way to the front. During the first six
months they lost seven pipers killed, eight wounded and two taken prisoner,
and the band ceased to exist.</p>

<p>"Baile Inneraora,"&mdash;otherwise "The Campbells are Coming"&mdash;was
the tune to which the first Highland regiment of the Expeditionary Force,
the 2nd Argylls, landed in France; from that time onward it has immortalised
on every front, if that were necessary, the town of which Burns wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"There's naething here but Highland pride</p>
<p class="verse4">And Highland scab and hunger.</p>
<p class="verse">If Providence has sent me here,</p>
<p class="verse4">'Twas surely in his anger."</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>The Argylls long ago took Burns' song and treated it with the contempt
it deserves when they adopted "Baile Inneraora" as their "onset." It
was played at the taking of Longueval, in the attack at Loos, and
at the subsequent rally after that glorious disaster, and in many other
actions.</p>

<p>During the fighting on the Somme for the heaps of ruins which had once
been a French village, an incident occurred which takes us back to the
legend connected with the pibroch "A Cholla, mo run." Long ages ago,
when the Campbells heard they were going to be attacked by Coll Kiteach
at Dunivaig, they set an ambush and captured the advance guard. All
were hanged except the piper, who was given permission to play a lament
over his comrades. The piper at once started the warning, which was
heard and understood by his comrades,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Coll of my love avoid the strait, avoid the strait, avoid the strait,</p>
<p class="verse">Coll of my love, go by the Mull, gain the landing place."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The poor piper was instantly stabbed by the infuriated Campbells.</p>

<p>It is a far cry from those days, when men could converse to each other
in pibroch, to 1916; but another tune&mdash;not "A Cholla, mo run"&mdash;was
played by another piper in a French village when his party was cut off.
Two officers, a sergeant, and a piper of an Argyll battalion, got separated
from the main body, and found themselves unable to get away when the
village was again attacked by our men. The small party at once started
bombing the enemy from the rear, but the piper, appreciating the unpleasant
possibility of their own presence not being recognised, struck up
the regimental onset. This alarmed the Germans, who thought they were
being attacked from a fresh quarter, and materially contributed to the
success of the operation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>


<h3>INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENTS.</h3>


<p class="pfs80">"Agus bha iad am measg uam fear treuna 'n an luchd-cuideachaidh 's a' chogadh."</p>

<p>To attempt to compile a complete record of the achievements of individual
pipers or of the pipe bands of units is an impossible task; it would involve
a review of the whole course of the war. A long time must elapse before
the histories of battalions are completed, and even then we shall probably
never know fully the extent to which their pipers have contributed to the
attainment of success.</p>

<p>Throughout the war correspondence has been carried on with individuals
who, in spite of their appalling environment, have found time to supply
information. They at least have the satisfaction of knowing that to them
is largely due the fact that brave acts have been saved from oblivion.</p>

<p>Such a review as follows is but a fragmentary one, based on information
obtained from officers, N.C.O.'s and men of the battalions concerned&mdash;but
almost never from individual pipers. Among these men there appears
to have been a conspiracy of silence, and attempts to obtain fuller information
as to the reason for the granting of awards or the names of pipers whose
identity disappeared under the blue pencil of the Censor have proved in
very many instances unavailing.</p>

<p>The omission from these pages of mention of achievements of pipers
of many battalions must be regarded as indicating lack of space to record
them, or of failure to obtain the desired information.</p>

<p>The original Expeditionary Force landed in France with seven Scottish
battalions possessing pipe bands; when the armistice was signed the
number of such units exceeded a hundred. Although on mobilisation
the number of "full" pipers in a battalion is only six it must be remembered
that there are always "acting pipers" serving in the companies who are
available&mdash;until that source of supply is exhausted&mdash;to take the place of
casualties; and it is safe to reckon that the 100 battalions have had more
than 2500 pipers at various times.</p>

<p>The numbers that served in various units during the campaign varied
enormously; in some, which freely utilised their pipers in the front line&mdash;in
the ranks, as bearers, and as pipers in action&mdash;as many as seventy or eighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
have been borne on the strength at different times; in others, which kept
these men invariably behind the front line, the casualties were negligible
and comparatively few were used up.</p>

<p>This difference in method of employment largely explains the variations
in the casualty lists and honours of different units; and, in some cases, it
has been found impossible to obtain anything like complete information.</p>

<p class="noindent">8543 Piper <span class="smcap">James Mackenzie</span>, 1st Scots Guards.</p>

<p>During the desperate fighting about Ypres in October, 1914, Piper Mackenzie

<p>On the 27th October, 1914, near Ypres, an advanced trench was blown to pieces
by shell fire, most of its occupants being killed or wounded. Hearing calls for help,
Piper Maguire went forward from the support trench to report. He crawled 15 yards
on hands and knees to the wrecked trench and found several men had been buried
by the explosion. Although without any protection from enemy fire he dug out a
man and found he was dead; he continued his task and got out another, placing
him for safety under cover of the dead body. He then crawled back to his trench.
The N.C.O. in charge had been killed meantime, and no official report of his conduct
was possible. Maguire himself was wounded shortly after, his back being broken; he
died of paralysis some seven months later.</p></div>

<p>During the operations on the Salonika front the battalion had to capture Karadzakot

over three successive charges to the enemy's position, and the commanding officer
considered their gallantry on this occasion was to a large extent instrumental in bringing
about the success of the attack. In spite of their exposed position they all got through
without being touched.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">Pipe Major <span class="smcap">David Anderson</span>, 15th Royal Scots.</p>

<p>In the opening attack on the Somme front on 1st July, 1916, the battalion was
played forward by the pipe major, to the old regimental tune "Dumbarton's drums."
He was hit shortly after going over the top, but continued playing; he was again
wounded after crossing the third line of trenches and fell to the ground. He tried
to go on playing while sitting on the ground, but his pipes were shattered by a shell
bursting near him. He managed to get up and was at once attacked by a German,
but succeeded in knocking him out with his fists, and then continued fighting with
a rifle until overcome by his wounds.</p>

<p>Pipe Major Anderson was given the one Croix de Guerre allotted to his Division
for the most conspicuous act of bravery. The pipes he was playing on this occasion
were of historical interest as they had been taken to the Antarctic by a member of
Scott's expedition, and had been played also in the Arctic expedition of 1907.</p>

<p>Another interesting feature of Anderson's achievement was that several Germans
surrendered to him as he played on the parapet of one of their trenches.</p></div>

played his battalion to the attack on the German position at Hooge on June 16, 1915.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
He played on right up to the German wire entanglements when, throwing his pipes
aside, he caught up the bayonet of a comrade who had just been shot by a German
officer and at once attacked the latter. He captured the officer.</p></div>

<p>The initial engagement of the battalion was the landing on Gallipoli. During the
first few days the pipers were fighting in the ranks, and the gallant exploit of Piper
Higginson is eloquent indication of the fact that they played the part of the fighting
man right well. All the officers and N.C.O.'s of his Company having been killed or
wounded during the heavy fighting of 26th April, 1915, Piper Higginson rallied the
remainder, and organised and led a bayonet charge with such dash and bravery that
the Turks were swept back from a line they had captured earlier in the day. Just
as success was attained Piper Higginson was mortally wounded, and died some hours
later. Had he survived he was to have been recommended for the D.C.M.</p></div>

<p>During most of their stay on the Gallipoli peninsula the pipers had to bring up
ammunition, rations, stores, etc., a job which was at all times most trying and often
extremely hazardous. For conspicuous bravery in charge of these carrying parties
the Pipe Major and Piper Maitland were awarded the Military Medal.</p></div>

<p>At the battle of Loos 25th September, 1915, when the battalion went forward to
the attack in which it was decimated, the first over the top was the Pipe Major, who
started playing at once. He was wounded and fell after a comparatively short distance,
but managed to crawl back. His leg had to be amputated, and he died of shock
shortly afterwards. Mackenzie was a man of nearly sixty years of age, and had forty-two
years' Army service. He was awarded a mention in despatches. Before the
action he had been detailed, on account of his age, to be postman, but insisted on going
into action.</p></div>

<p>Just before the attack on Hill 70 and Loos on 25th September, 1915, the battalion,
which was under heavy shell fire, was exposed to a cloud of poison gas. Many of
the men succumbed to this gas, and the remainder were shaken by what they were
going through. The commanding officer, seeing Laidlaw standing waiting with his
pipes for the order to advance, called to him, "Pipe them together, Laidlaw, for God's
sake, pipe them together," and he immediately climbed out on to the parapet, and
marched up and down, regardless of danger, playing "Blue Bonnets over the Border."
The effect on the men was magical; at the same moment the order came to advance,
and the officer shouted "Come on, the Borderers, who'll be the first to reach the
German trenches?" The survivors of the company swarmed up and over to the
assault following the piper. The men were falling all round him, but Laidlaw continued
to advance until he got near the German line, when he was wounded and the officer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
who was alongside of him, was killed. As he lay on the ground he tried to go on
playing, and then managed to get up and hobble after the battalion.</p>

<p>He was awarded the Victoria Cross "for most conspicuous gallantry," and the
French Croix de Guerre.</p>

<p>The sobriquet "Piper of Loos" was commonly applied to Piper Laidlaw; though,
in fairness to two other men, it must be admitted that he only shared that distinction
with them.</p></div>

men lying about who had been gassed. Pipe Major Taylor, though himself wounded
in the hand, continued bringing in these men for thirty-six hours, until he was himself

into a shell hole and lay there for four days before he succeeded in crawling back to
our trenches. When he fell there were loud shouts "The piper's down," and the men

<p>In the attack by the 2nd Black Watch at Mauquissart, 25th September, 1915, the
pipers took a prominent part, playing their companies up to and through the German
first and second lines. After three lines had been captured the order to attack the
fourth was given. 736 Piper David Simpson at once dashed forward playing, followed
by his company; he was killed just as they reached the objective. His bravery
earned him the title, for long after, of "The Piper of Loos." He was recommended
for the Victoria Cross. Further on, 1839 Piper Alexander Macdonald alternately
played from one trench to the next and assisted in bombing the enemy out of their
dugouts. In the third trench he marched, playing "Macgregor's Gathering," down
the trench at the head of the bombers, and then climbed on to the parapet and continued
playing. He was ultimately wounded and lost his leg. For his gallantry he was
given the D.C.M., but did not long survive to enjoy the honour as he died soon after
his discharge. At the same time 365 Piper R. Johnstone went on playing until he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
fell gassed. As pipers fell out wounded others took their places, and the battalion
was played continuously into and through the action. It appears to have been a
tradition among the pipers of this battalion that they were always to play whenever
an opportunity occurred. Pipers David Armit and J. Galloway also played right up
to and through the German support trenches.</p></div>

<p>In the attack at Loos, when the battalion was played in by their pipers, most of
these men were killed or wounded. At one time the position became very serious and
the advance was checked. Pipers Fraser and Hamilton at once got up into the open
and started playing "Caber Feidh"; the effect was very marked as their companies
dashed forward after them. They were both killed.</p></div>

disregard of danger under the continuous fire of heavy guns."</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">Pipe Major <span class="smcap">B. M'Donald</span>, Highland Light Infantry.</p>

<p>An ammunition dump having caught fire he went in under heavy machine gun

shell crater full of water. By this means he stopped the conflagration. At the time
he had just been given a commission, and he received for this action the Military Cross.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">16094 Pipe Major <span class="smcap">Young Gilbert</span>, 17th Highland Light Infantry.</p>

<p>On the 1st July, 1916, the battalion crawled up to within 100 yards of the Leipzig
redoubt and rushed the latter when the barrage lifted, and held on. The position was
a very perilous one, and the C.O. called on the Pipe Major to play to the men. This
he at once did and continued doing so, with the most stimulating effect on the
battalion. For this action he was awarded the Military Medal.</p></div>

High Wood to Longueval. Advancing beyond the first objective they advanced
further and tried to dig in, but came under deadly fire from flank and rear. Of the
two leading platoons only one wounded officer and five men ever got back. Piper
Ritchie volunteered to carry a message to regimental headquarters and bring up
reinforcements. He did this twice. He was awarded the Military Medal.</p></div>

and at Ypres. He was specially promoted to Sergeant and awarded the D.C.M. and
the Russian Order of St. George for bringing up ammunition under particularly trying
circumstances at Ypres. He was killed at Loos.</p></div>

<p>In the summer of 1918 the pipers, during the offensive, were attached for duty
to the 23rd Field Ambulance. All the wounded had to be carried across a deep and
very rapid burn, which was difficult to get across for a single man. These pipers,
however, with four men to a stretcher and four more to steady them, and without their
kilts and hose, succeeded in getting large numbers of casualties over. They stood in
the water for many hours. Subsequently they went out to look for wounded and
brought in many more. "But for the work of the pipers and drummers it would have
been impossible to evacuate the wounded that night."</p></div>

shell had burst and knocked over a dozen of our men and he at once went off to give
first aid. On the way he saw Captain &mdash;&mdash; of the 2nd Gordons lying wounded. As,
on account of his own wound, he was unable to carry the wounded officer in, he took
off his own puttees, wound them round his knees as a protection, took Captain &mdash;&mdash; on

<p>When the battalion attacked Longueval it was met by heavy machine gun fire,
which caused very severe casualties. Part of the enemy wire had been left uncut by our
bombardment, and this caused momentary confusion in the ranks, as it was very
dark. The advance was held up by some ruined dwellings in the streets of the village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
which had been turned into machine gun nests. Pipers Dall and Wilson at once started

The men of different units got mixed up in the hand to hand fighting which ensued, and
it was necessary to rally them in their own units. Piper Cameron stood under heavy

<p>Subsequently, in the attack on Hill 70 on 15th August, 1918, he again led the

<p>At Festubert in May, 1915, he showed the greatest gallantry in carrying despatches,
and also saved a wounded comrade's life. In the attack on the Regina trench on
8th October, 1916, he played his company to the attack. When they got near the
enemy's position very heavy wire entanglements were encountered, which took a
considerable time to cut through; while this was being carried out Piper Richardson
marched up and down outside the wire playing, while the men were falling all round
him. When the wire had been cut he continued at the head of his company, and
played the "Reel of Tulloch" on the German parapet, followed by the "Deil in the
Kitchen" as the battalion started bombing the dugouts. At this moment the Company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Sergeant Major was dangerously wounded and Richardson volunteered to take him
out. He successfully accomplished this and then said he must go back to fetch his
pipes which he had left behind in the captured trench. He never returned and must
have been killed. The Commanding Officer<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> writes of him: "I really think his V.C.
performance was one of the great deeds of the war. The conditions were those of
indescribable peril and terror. The lad's whole soul was bound up in the glory of
piping, and he was only taken into action after imploring his colonel with tears
in his eyes. Altogether a most wonderful example of high souled courage and
enthusiasm."</p>

<p>A year after Piper Richardson's death he was awarded a posthumous Victoria
Cross.</p></div>

<h3>FOREIGNERS AND THE PIPES</h3>

<p>Brought in contact as Scottish troops have been with those of our Allies
it is not surprising that military pipers have attracted the attention of
observers and writers who, before the war, knew nothing of their existence.
From the early days of the war the pipes, the tartan and the kilt aroused
the liveliest interest in France; and perhaps the sincerest tribute to them
is the fact that, in their caricatures of the nations, the Germans usually
depicted the British soldier as a particularly unattractive Highlander.</p>

<p>At first the French writers were mildly sarcastic about the players of the
"cornemuse," and regarded them as an amiable weakness of the comrades
of the "auld alliance"; but gradually they discovered that pipes and
tartan were the outward and visible signs of a spirit which won their whole-hearted
admiration, and then their attitude changed.</p>

<p>Describing an attack by the 51st Division a French observer wrote:</p>

<p>"Resolutely they crossed what seemed to be impossible ground ... they
charged to the shrill sounds of the bagpipes ... they charged like heroes
of Walter Scott&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">leurs bonnets à rubans et leur jupes de danseuses</i>."</p>

<p>Though the Breton bignon, the cornemuse, the German dudelsackpfeife
are no longer&mdash;if they ever were&mdash;instruments of war, the instinctive admiration
for the pipes remains in the most unexpected quarters; and in France,
Flanders, Italy, the Balkans, and even the occupied portions of Germany,
"<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">piob mhor</i>" has aroused race memories long dormant. One effect of
this is the demand which has recently arisen in Italy for pipes from this
country; another is the fact that the French Government have added a
painting of a piper by a French artist to the official collection of war pictures.</p>

<p>American observers were often very ignorant of the mysteries of the
bagpipe. A writer in the <cite>Boston Evening Transcript</cite>, after eulogising the
piper as a military institution, informs his readers that in the hands of a
really skilled performer the strains of the pipes can be heard for a distance
of six miles against the wind or ten miles if the conditions are favourable.
The writer may have been of M'Crimmon descent, but his enthusiasm
exceeded his powers of observation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>One thing is quite certain, viz., whatever their inmost feelings regarding
the musical qualities of the pipes, foreigners generally appreciate their
military value in war and share the opinion of the court-martial in 1746 that
they must be regarded as an "instrument of war."</p>

<p>The Germans certainly were not slow in forming an estimate of the
military value of the piper. From a very early stage in the war they learned
to associate the instrument with a type of troops for whose mentality,
as exhibited in the attack, they had more respect than sympathy, and
the piper at once became a marked man whenever he went over the top.
The casualties among pipers while playing would of themselves suggest
that this was the case; but the statements of officer prisoners show that
orders were given to pick off pipers for precisely the same reason as officers
commanding platoons or companies.</p>


<h3>THE PIPES IN CAPTIVITY</h3>

<p>Even pipers fall into the hands of the enemy occasionally, but they
were never allowed to take their instruments with them into captivity.
Gradually, as "comforts," pipes were sent out to individual officers and
men; and the following letter from an officer of the Gordon Highlanders
who was at Friedberg Camp, indicates how popular pipe music became
among his fellow-prisoners of the Allied armies.</p>

<p>Though only a young player I play here every day and do not find
people too hostile to me. The Russians, French and even the Germans
greet me with great interest and seem to find pleasure in listening to me&mdash;though
as I said I am no great player; the most unsympathetic are always
to be found among the ranks of the "Sassenach." I learnt to play in 1911,
on joining my Regiment, under George MacLennan, who was Pipe-Major
at that time. While on leave in Edinburgh I used to have lessons with
his father&mdash;Jno. MacLennan. Up till now I have only attempted "The
Glen is mine" and "Struan Robertson" in Piobaireachd, but having
been thoroughly taught by the MacLennans I naturally follow their way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>of thinking. Yesterday I played to a Russian who is a very good player of
the piano. He was delighted with the Pipes and I could not play too
many tunes for him. Strathspeys and Reels are greatly appreciated by all
our Russian friends. Last St. Andrew's Day we organized an Exhibition
of dancing which was a complete success. As the Scottish Colony here
is so small we asked the Russians to come and help us. This they did
right well with dances and songs, the music being provided, in both cases,
by "Balalaika," or Russian national instrument. For our part we danced
two foursome Reels (dancing two different sets of steps), a Sword Dance
and a Highland Schottische. In the latter dance we each took a Russian
as a partner, they having been trained up for the event. We sang "Bonnie
Dundee," "Lassies of Scotland," "MacPherson," and finished up with
"Auld Lang Syne." For the Reels my Russian friend provided the music
on the piano. Our costume was of course improvised. Kilt, shoes and
hose we had, we wore white shirts with lace cuffs, a strip of tartan fastened
with a brooch at the shoulder to do duty as a plaid and a black velvet band
with a lace ruffle, falling down in front, round our necks. Our <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'sporans'">sporrans</ins>,
with the exception of one which was made out of a local rabbit, all came
from home. I had several pretty compliments paid to me by the Russians
and French, both on our costume and dancing. Five of us took part
altogether. I wonder if it would be too much to ask you to send me instructions
for dancing the "Lochaber Broadswords" and the "Seann Triubhas,"
in case we have the misfortune to pass another St. Andrew's Day here in
Germany. If we do we shall give another Exhibition and I would like
to be able to vary it. I only know 12 Strathspey steps and 8 Reel steps.
Since I have been a prisoner I have taught over 30 people to dance the
Reel&mdash;including two Frenchmen and one Russian, and at present I have
five pupils on the chanter. We are 16 Scots here, so can you say we are
losing our national distinctions? I have only told you this because I
thought it would interest you."</p></div>

<p>In Holland, in the internment camps, an organised pipe band was
instituted by the writer of the above letter, and consisted of thirteen pipers
of whom two were pipe majors.</p>

<h2><a name="MILITARY_PIPE_BANDS_AND_REFORM" id="MILITARY_PIPE_BANDS_AND_REFORM"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">MILITARY PIPE BANDS, AND REFORM</a></h2>

<p>In preparing this record of the pipe bands of our Armies during the
war the opportunity has been taken of consulting pipe presidents and pipe
majors as to the present condition of military piping and the manner in
which obvious defects might be remedied. Like other experts they exhibit
divergences of opinion, sometimes as regards the nature of the defects,
sometimes as to the best method of remedying them. In certain matters,
however, there is absolute unanimity, and these are deserving of attention
by the military authorities.</p>

<p>"<em>Sergeant piper.</em>"&mdash;Throughout the Army there is, and has always
been, a strong objection to the title of "sergeant piper," which in official
parlance is employed instead of "pipe major." No one ever calls a pipe
major a sergeant piper, except in returns; and withdrawal of this modern
and indefensible title could result in nothing but good. As there is no
financial aspect involved in the change, it would be a graceful and inexpensive
concession to a body of men to whom the Army and the nation owe much.</p>

<p><em>Rank of the Pipe Major.</em>&mdash;On another point there is absolute unanimity
of opinion, viz., the rank of the pipe major. As responsible for a band
possibly numbering twenty or more pipers, the pipe major ought to have the
same rank as a bandmaster. To limit the career of a piper to the possibility
of becoming a pipe major with the rank of sergeant is to prevent good
men accepting the position; and many a man, seeing he can hope for no
advancement, leaves the pipes and returns to the ranks, thus getting a
chance of rising to warrant rank.</p>

<p>This question of rank has a most important bearing on the interests
of piping generally, and is therefore a national one. As instructor to
his men the pipe major should be a first-class performer himself, and
this&mdash;although the public appear to be unaware of the fact&mdash;involves
long and assiduous training. It is useless asking a man to attain the necessary
standard of excellence for this purpose and to offer him the pay of a
sergeant in return. The consequence is pipe majors are not always the
best pipers&mdash;from the professional point of view&mdash;in their units; and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
ought to be remedied, even though it does cost the nation the difference
between the emoluments of a warrant officer and of a sergeant in each
unit.</p>

<p><em>The Appointment of "Piper."</em>&mdash;Another necessary reform, which also
has the merit of costing nothing, is the official recognition of "piper"
as an appointment. In the Army "drummer" is an appointment, but
a piper is a private.</p>

<p>One result of this is that, on mobilisation, all pipers revert to the ranks,
excepting six (including the sergeant piper) per battalion. Apart altogether
from the special liability to casualties among the "full pipers" when playing
in action, it is evident that so small a band may, under the ordinary conditions
of modern warfare, be put out of action; and then great difficulty is
experienced in raising another band. In many battalions during the war
this happened, sometimes more than once; and it is these battalions which
are most insistent on the strength being twelve instead of six pipers.</p>

<p><em>Lowland regiments.</em>&mdash;A grievance which cries for remedy at the hands
of the War Office is the treatment of pipers in Lowland regiments. The
official view appears to be that the existence of the pipes in regiments
such as the Royal Scots, the K.O.S.B.'s and others is an unreasonable
concession to a sentiment which is vulgarly called "Scotch," but which,
though believed to be nebulous, happens to be too strong for the military
reformers to ignore altogether. This view indicates ignorance of the history
of the pipes and of the Lowland regiments; the one may be pardoned,
the other is inexcusable.</p>

<p>It is absolutely certain that Lowland regiments had pipers before the
existing Highland regiments were raised at all; and the pipes were a national
instrument all over the Lowlands for centuries before there was any Regular
Army at all.</p>

<p>This being so it is quite illogical that the maintenance of their pipe bands
should be a greater financial burden on officers of a Lowland than of a Highland
regiment. The value of the institution, from a military point of view,
is the same in both; and pipe bands should be treated as part of the recognised
establishment in one as in the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Standardisation of military pipe music.</em>&mdash;There is one grave defect in
military piping which is capable of being remedied quite easily. Anyone
who knows anything of piping knows that each individual piper learns
his tunes after the setting of some well-known authority, and is for ever
after prepared to maintain that that version alone is the correct one. Unfortunately
every battalion has its own setting for every tune played in
the band and declines to admit the possibility of any other setting being used
in any circumstances. Even in the case of distinctively regimental tunes,
<em>e.g.</em> "<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Cabar Feidh</i>," the two Regular battalions of the Seaforth Highlanders
play&mdash;or used to play, just before the war&mdash;different settings of that tune,
and a man transferred from one battalion to another had to learn the slight
differences which his new unit preferred. The same remarkable individuality
exists in every battalion and makes it very difficult indeed to get
a number of pipe bands to play even the best-known tunes together without
considerable practice.</p>

<p>This is quite wrong. By all means let the individual piper learn and
adhere to the setting of piobaireachd by his favourite authority; but to
have as many settings of an ordinary march as there are battalions in the
Army is not to the advantage of piping.</p>

<p>The remedy is simple enough,&mdash;the standardisation of pipe tunes for
military purposes, in precisely the same manner as obtains with the National
Anthems and trumpet and bugle calls; and, just as no departure to meet
regimental custom or prejudice is permitted in the case of these latter,
so the setting laid down for the Army in the case of pipe tunes should be
strictly defined and adhered to.</p>

<p>The superiority of one setting over another does not enter into the
question; what is essential is uniformity.</p>

<p>Many pipe majors have pointed to this standardisation as one of the
most important measures to be adopted after the war, in the interests of
piping in the Army.</p>

<p><em>Neglect of Piobaireachd.</em>&mdash;It is open to argument whether the military
piper does or does not exert a determining influence on the cause of piping
generally. Allowing fully for the great value of the recognised societies and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the periodical piping meetings throughout Scotland, in keeping up the
standard of the national instrument and offering inducements for its study,
it will be readily admitted that, by their mere existence as permanent
institutions, military pipe bands keep up the cult of the pipes, at home
and abroad, to so marked a degree that any decline in their standard must
have a deleterious effect on piping generally.</p>

<p>To what extent, then, if at all, is military piping conducted to the best
advantage of the cause of piping, and is there room for reform?</p>

<p>It may be taken as generally the case that, in so far as a military pipe
band is regarded as designed for duty on the march, and for various routine
military musical duties, it fulfils its functions to the satisfaction of all concerned.
It is too much to expect the War Office&mdash;or even individual commanding
officers&mdash;to accept the view that neglect of "ceol mor" is not compensated
for by a high standard of excellence in the "middle music" and in dances
and marches. Individual pipers in every battalion are players of "piobaireachd";
but any one with experience of regimental or garrison piping
competitions knows how small is the number of men who enter for that
class of event, as compared with performers of the march, strathspey
and reel.</p>

<p>The explanation is simple enough&mdash;the men play what their audience
demands, and "Leaving Glen Urquhart" or "Duntroon" appeals to more
people, military or civil, than the finest piobaireachd. Pipe majors, even
when themselves anxious to teach their pipers the higher class of music,
recognise that to attempt to do so would often be wasted labour&mdash;men
come to them too old to make piobaireachd players, and, in any case, the
opportunities for playing it in the Army are too few to make it worth while
trying to get men to go through the initial drudgery. Being human they
naturally turn to march and dance music; and the result is that, except
in the case of professional pipers who have enlisted, the soldier piper generally
ignores altogether the classical side of his music.</p>

<p>This is a defect in military piping, and it should be remedied by insisting
that, before promotion to pipe major, a piper should pass an examination
in every branch of pipe music.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p><em>A school of piping.</em>&mdash;The time has come to establish a school of piping for
the army at which likely pipers could undergo refresher courses of instruction
in all classes of pipe music, in the correct writing of music&mdash;a subject which
is lamentably ignored, in the theory of music, and in methods of instruction
of recruit pipers. In other words it should fulfil the same functions as
regards the training of future pipe majors, and the improvement of the
standard of playing in the army, that Kneller Hall does in the case of
bandmasters and military musical education generally.</p>

<p>No piper should be promoted pipe major until he has undergone a
complete course lasting at least six months, and has passed an examination
at the end of it.</p>

<p>Such a school should be open to civilian pipers and should become the
Macrimmon school of to-day.</p>

<p>The Piobaireachd Society have already decided to institute a memorial
to fallen pipers which shall take this form, and to the necessary endowment
the proceeds of this book will be devoted. But the army must contribute
towards its maintenance.</p>

<p class="drop-capx">These Records are not based on military returns, and are therefore
not, in all cases, complete. They have been obtained by correspondence
with commanding officers, pipe presidents, pipe majors and
many others, but the exigencies of war have prevented the information
so obtained being absolutely accurate.</p>

<p>In many cases, units, reduced by fighting to mere cadres, have been
absorbed into other units and their pipers scattered; in others, the field
records of the units themselves have been lost or have ceased to be available;
and, in several, correspondence has been abruptly terminated by the correspondent
himself being killed or wounded.</p>

<p>In the circumstances it is satisfactory that so much information has
been obtained.</p>

<p class="p1 center"><span class="smcap">1st Battalion.</span></p>

<p>During the first few months of the war there were very heavy casualties
among the pipers, and the band soon ceased to exist in consequence. It was
reconstituted in 1916, but was not again utilised in the front line.</p>

<p>In the capture of Karadzakot Zir, in the Salonika operations, the battalion
was played to the attack by Pipers Collins, Clancy, Smart and Mallin, and
the C.O. considers that their services on this occasion "were of inestimable
value; it was largely due to the presence of the pipers with the leading
wave that the enemy evacuated their trenches and retired in disorder."
Besides their value on the march and in billets "they were invaluable in
inspiring <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> under fire."</p>

<p>Pipers were also employed as observers, messengers, scouts, etc.</p>

<p class="p1 center"><span class="smcap">2nd Battalion</span></p>

<p>The 2nd battalion took part in the original fighting of the war. During
the retirement from Mons the pipers were chiefly employed as despatch-runners
and orderlies. They went out with 16 pipers and lost 6 during
the first few weeks. Four pipers, including Pipe Major Duff, were taken
prisoner at Audincourt on 26th August, 1914.</p>

<p>During the Somme fighting they were employed as stretcher-bearers
and suffered severe casualties. On one occasion they did invaluable service
in bringing water up to the battalion. At Ypres in September, 1916, the
pipers were carrying barbed wire up to the front when a shell wounded
three. After that the band was withdrawn from the front line and employed
in playing the battalion to and from the trenches. By the end of 1918
there had been 7 pipers killed, 16 wounded and 4 taken prisoner, and, to
quote the pipe major, "I have seen 3 bands disappear and the fourth is
now on German soil."</p>

<p>Apart from the difficulty of replacement of casualties one of the
reasons why pipers were not used in attacks was because it was felt
"when the men heard the pipes they would lose control of themselves
and, in their eagerness to get forward would be apt to rush into their
own barrage."</p>

<p>During the Gallipoli fighting the whole of the pipers became casualties,
some of them while acting as pipers, others while serving in the ranks.
Shortly after the landing, 1235 Piper Sinclair gathered together some
stragglers and successfully covered the retirement of his battalion at a
critical period. He himself died of his wounds. The band ceased to exist
until again started in 1916. Writing of their subsequent experiences the
commanding officer says "they gloriously upheld the traditions achieved
by their predecessors."</p>

their value in keeping the men cheery, and on the march, so great that
they should not be allowed in the front line at all. "When the men were
exhausted and inclined to straggle the effect of the pipes was most marked,
the men at once pulled themselves together."</p>

<p class="p1 center"><span class="smcap">1st Battalion</span></p>

<p>In the landing on Gallipoli the pipers of the battalion had to take their
places in the ranks in the first line fighting; here they distinguished themselves.
During the subsequent operations in the Peninsula the pipers
were employed in miscellaneous duties behind the front line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the 10 pipers who landed only 4 remained to accompany the battalion
on its evacuation.</p>

<p>In France they were employed in any and every capacity; "as bearers
and ammunition carriers they had tasks to carry out that were almost
superhuman, but as a band they ceased to exist until May 1917, when they
were reconstituted. It was then decided to keep them out of the front line
altogether."</p>

<p>The opinion of the officers is that pipers are far too valuable an institution
to be employed in action in any capacity. The C.O. considers the band
"plays no inconsiderable part in promoting the efficiency of a fighting
force."</p>

battalion was played over the top by the Pipe Major, Robert Mackenzie.
The casualties in this action, 4 killed and 3 wounded, resulted in the temporary
disappearance of the band. At Arras, Ypres, and in later engagements, the
men were employed as bearers.</p>

<p>Just before the attack at Loos when there was a very heavy bombardment
and gas discharge, Piper Daniel Laidlaw got up on the parapet and
played the men over the top and continued until he fell wounded. For
this act he was awarded the V.C. Another piper, Douglas Taylor, who
had been wounded in the hand and could not play, went out and brought
in several wounded men who had been gassed; he continued until he was
dangerously wounded.</p>

<p>During the first eighteen months of the campaign the whole of the pipers
were wounded.</p>

<p>The enormous value of pipes to a battalion returning from the front line
is recognised by all ranks.</p>

<p>Pipers during the first part of the war were chiefly in the ranks, and
the casualties among them were so heavy they had to be withdrawn. The
band was reconstituted, and the pipers were then kept out of the front line.
In March 1918 they again had to be employed as rifles.</p>

<p class="p1 center"><span class="smcap">1st Battalion</span></p>

<p>During the opening stages the pipers were necessarily mostly employed
in the ranks, and, within the first three months, practically the whole of the
13 pipers were casualties. During the Somme fighting the companies
were repeatedly played to the attack by their pipers; on one of these
occasions the pipe major, M'Leod, was killed. At Rue des Bois in May 1915,
when the battalion attacked the German positions near Festubert, every
company was played up, and Pipers Stuart and Wishart distinguished

<p>At Neuve Chapelle, March 1915, and at many other subsequent engagements,
the pipers lost heavily. At Mauquissart on 25th September, 1915,
when the companies were played to the attack, one piper, Robert Johnstone,
played on until he fell gassed; and another, Armit, on reaching the enemy
trenches, started bombing. On the same occasion, Pipers David Simpson
and A. Macdonald stood on the parapet under very heavy fire playing their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
company over; Simpson was killed and Macdonald, who lost his leg, received
the D.C.M. The pipers were also employed as bombers, and in this capacity
Lance-Corpl. Peter MacNee obtained the D.C.M. at Neuve Chapelle.</p>

<p>On another occasion Pipers Gordon and Crichton played from one end
of the line to the other out in the open, and similar feats were subsequently
performed by other pipers.</p>

<p>While the battalion was in France, out of 22 pipers 4 were killed and
13 were wounded, during the first year of the war.</p>

<p>The battalion subsequently went to Mesopotamia. Here again the
pipers were employed, sometimes in miscellaneous duties in the ranks,
sometimes as pipers. The pipe major, John Keith, was awarded the D.C.M.
Piper Pratt was promoted and given the D.C.M. for "high capacity in
leadership" when acting as sergeant.</p>

for their gallantry at Neuve Chapelle in March 1915; at Loos
they were similarly employed, and Piper M'Leod was awarded the Military
Medal for gallantry in bringing in his colonel, who was mortally wounded,
under very heavy fire. On 3rd September, 1916, the battalion was played
in to the attack, but, as a rule, they were kept back behind the front line.

<p>Pipers were employed in many ways, but chiefly as stretcher-bearers.
The band was regarded by the men as the best stretcher-bearers they came
across. At High Wood in July 1916 the battalion was played over by Pipers
Pirnie, Forbes, Mapleton and Tainsh.</p>

<p>Since September 1916 they have been kept out of the front line as far
as possible.</p>

<p>On several occasions in Gallipoli the battalion was played to the attack
by pipers. Piper Maclennan was awarded the D.C.M. Piper Macfarlane
had the drones blown off his pipes. The acting pipers served in the ranks
or as bearers. Piper D. Cameron was mentioned in despatches for conspicuous
bravery in playing his company over the top, and right on to the
enemy trenches. These men also did great work in bringing up water for
the wounded under heavy fire, and ammunition.</p>

<p>During trench warfare the pipers acted as orderlies, stretcher bearers
and the like; in engagements, however, they took part as company pipers.
So many casualties occurred in the Loos action in Sept. 1915 that there
was only one survivor. The band ceased to exist until the following spring,
and it was then decided to allow only half of the pipers to go up into the line
or into action.</p>

<p>During the battles of the Somme, 1916, and Arras, 1917, the companies
were played into action by one piper each; casualties occurring among
them, it was decided again to withdraw them from the front; and they
took no part in the fighting at Ypres, 1917.</p>

<p>During the last phase of the war, the attack in Flanders on 28th Sept.
1918, the pipers played their companies throughout their triumphant
attacks on the Germans.</p>

<p>The C.O. of the battalion says: "I cannot speak too highly of the
work done by the pipers of this unit. There is nothing I can think of which
has added more to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> of the men, which has enabled them
to put up with misery and discomfort and which has given them the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>

<p>At Thiepval and Beaumont Hamel the pipers lost very heavily when
leading their companies, and, as a consequence, it was found necessary afterwards
to keep them in the reserve line. In April 1918, on account of heavy
casualties in the battalion, they had to be employed in the ranks, and suffered
very heavily; of 20 pipers all but 3 became casualties, mostly through being
gassed at Ayette. Within a month, however, the band was reconstituted.</p>

<p>In the attack on the Leipzig Redoubt on 1st July, 1916, when the
battalion had to hang on unsupported to a part of the captured Leipzig
Redoubt, the pipers played and did an immense deal in keeping the men's
spirits up. Pipe Major Gilbert on this occasion won the Military Medal.
The casualties in this attack put the pipe band out of action, and the pipers
were thereafter kept, as far as possible, out of the front line. The battalion
was subsequently merged in the 15th H.L.I.</p>

<h3>THE SEAFORTH HIGHLANDERS</h3>

<p class="p1 center"><span class="smcap">1st Battalion</span></p>

<p>The casualties among the pipers of this battalion have been very heavy.
At Richebourg in November 1914, 2 pipers were killed and 6 wounded,
and the pipe major, Matheson, was awarded the D.C.M. for great gallantry
in carrying messages. In December 1914, and again at Neuve Chapelle in
May 1915, 3 more were killed and 4 wounded. Some of them were employed
as pipers, others as bearers and in the ranks. At Neuve Chapelle the companies
were played into action in May 1915, and Piper Pratt was killed
while playing.</p>

<p>The battalion went to Mesopotamia, and in the action at Sheikh Saad
on 7th January, 1916, Pipe Major M'Kechnie played the regimental charge
at a most crucial moment and continued until he fell wounded. In this
and other subsequent engagements pipers played their companies into
action. Some of them did excellent work bringing up ammunition, and
529 Piper Colin M'Kay was specially promoted for this. This duty was
particularly dangerous as the Turkish barrage was generally late.</p>

<p>The casualties continued to be heavy. Altogether 11 pipers have been
killed.</p>

<p>The pipers were largely employed as runners, orderlies, etc., and suffered
very heavy casualties. On several occasions during the open fighting they
were employed in the attack as pipers. Of 23 pipers who went to France
with the battalion 6 were killed and 10 wounded in the first year of the war.
The opinion of the officers is that only the difficulty of reinforcements limits
the employment of pipers in action.</p>

was decided in the later stages to keep them out of action as much as possible.
Five pipers were killed and sixteen wounded.</p>

<p>At Loos the battalion was played to the attack, and had 5 pipers killed
and 3 wounded. At one time, when the position was very serious, a piper
rallied the men with "Cabar Feidh," and produced a tremendous effect.
On the Somme, in 1916, a piper was always on duty with the battalion. At
Arras, in 1917, the pipers acted as bearers, but in later operations they were
kept out of the front line as far as possible.</p>

<p>Pipers were frequently employed as despatch runners. In the advance
of the 26th Brigade at Longueval on 14th July, 1916, the battalion was
played into action under very heavy fire. When attacking the village they
met with a stout resistance and came under heavy machine gun fire from
a flank as well as from the front. The pipers rallied the men who were
thrown momentarily into confusion, and, at their head, charged down the
street and over the wires into the German trenches.</p>

<p>The casualties were heavy throughout, 4 killed and 15 wounded.</p>

<p>This battalion took 32 pipers out to France; by the end of the first
year of the campaign 10 had been killed and 20 wounded. At Loos and
in the Somme fighting the pipers of the 2nd Gordons repeatedly played
the battalion into action and suffered heavily. The pipers were also
employed as runners, bearers, etc., and in the ranks.</p>

<p>In March 1915, the battalion was played to the attack on the Aubers
Ridge under heavy fire, and again at Mametz and Guichy.</p>

<p>In the Italian field of operations they did most excellent work in getting
the wounded back across a swift river, work which their C.O. considered it
would have been impossible to accomplish without their enthusiastic
assistance.</p>

<p>During the trench fighting the pipers were mostly used behind the
front line, and in marching the battalion to and from rest billets. Subsequently,
in open fighting, the company pipers took their place at the heads
of their companies. At the Marne, Pipers P. Paterson, R. Prentice, P. Bowie
and G. Davidson played their companies into action, and their action
immensely stimulated the troops "and enabled them to gain a great victory
on that day"; at Ypres on 31st July, 1917, Piper P. Bowie "rallied the
men at a time when fighting was very fierce," and was awarded the Military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Medal; on 17th November, 1917, Piper G. Paterson also got the Military
Medal for playing the battalion through three successive charges and into
Cantaing under heavy fire. The pipers were also employed as ammunition
carriers.</p>

<p>At Neuve Chapelle the pipers headed the charge of the battalion on the
Moulin du Piètre, losing one piper killed and four wounded.</p>

<p>Pipers were mostly employed in action as stretcher bearers or in the
ranks, and, while suffering heavily, won the highest reputation in their
battalion. At Neuve Chapelle in March 1915 they lost one killed and six
wounded; on this occasion Pipe Major Howarth won the D.C.M. At Loos
in the following September, the casualties were again heavy, and the pipe
major won a bar to the D.C.M. In later operations pipers were kept, as
much as possible, out of the front line.</p>

<p>Pipers were not employed as such, but, during the early part of the war,
they were in the ranks. At the battle of the Aisne and Ypres the casualties
were heavy.</p>

<p>The value to the battalion of their pipe band is considered so great that
the officers would like the establishment doubled.</p>

<p>There were heavy casualties among the pipers, who were employed in
many ways throughout the war,&mdash;largely in the ranks. One, Lance-Corporal
Johnstone, was awarded the D.C.M. and M.M. for his gallantry as a guide
in 1915 and subsequently as scout sergeant. Throughout the war the
pipers went into action with their companies. The opinion of the com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>manding
officer is that they have been invaluable to the battalion. At the
time of the advance into Bulgaria sickness had caused the disappearance
of the band.</p>

<p>Altogether 14 pipers were wounded and 7 died or were killed during
the war.</p>

attack by their pipers, and these men came through unscathed but with
their pipes rendered useless by mud and water. Of those who were serving
in the ranks several were killed and wounded at Festubert.</p>

<p>When in Gallipoli the full pipers were chiefly employed as messengers
and ammunition carriers. In the latter capacity they did excellent work
in the fighting on 12th July, 1915. The acting pipers were employed as
stretcher bearers. On the occasion of the 12th July attack a piper mounted
the parapet and played the battalion over. The pipers have been kept out
of action as far as possible.</p>

<p>During the trench fighting the pipers were kept in the reserve lines in
order to avoid casualties. At Loos and on the Somme, however, they were
employed with their companies, and at the taking of Longueval they behaved
with quite remarkable gallantry. On this occasion Pipe Major Aitken, a
man of sixty years of age, was awarded the D.C.M., and Pipers Wilson and
Dall were commended for playing through heavy machine gun fire. At the
same time Piper Donnachie greatly distinguished himself carrying despatches.</p>

<p>The commanding officer says the casualties on the Somme have led
him to keep them out of action as far as possible, as he regards them as
invaluable to a regiment. It was, in the later stages, only under dire
necessity, that pipers were occasionally used as bearers.</p>

<p>When the battalion was in support of the 44th Brigade at Loos the pipers
took a very prominent share in the glory and the losses of the day. One,
Charles Cameron, stood out in the open and played as a rallying point, and
the battalion called him "The Piper of Loos." Other pipers were employed
as runners, or in the ranks.</p>

<p>The casualties during this part of the campaign were so heavy that the
pipe band was kept, as far as possible, out of the front line.</p>

<h3>THE LONDON SCOTTISH</h3>

<p class="p1 center"><span class="smcap">1st Battalion</span></p>

<p>During the earlier part of the war the pipers served in the ranks and
suffered heavy casualties. In the fighting at Messines on 31st October, 1914,
and the subsequent operations at Zillebeke, 4 were killed and 2 were wounded,
and of the original pipe band only one remained after six months. All
these casualties occurred while the men were acting as observers. Several
pipers were subsequently given commissions in other regiments.</p>

<p>Owing to the great difficulty of replacement every effort has been made,
during the last two years of the war, to keep pipers out of the front line.</p>

<p>The pipers of this battalion have served in three theatres of war. They
have played through Flanders and France, across the desert and in Palestine.
They led the battalion into Jerusalem on 9th Dec., 1917, and thereafter
on across the Jordan, through the hills of Gilead, and in Jericho, and
Bethlehem. Again in Salonika and among the Macedonian hills they
carried the music of the Highlands. In the desert difficulties were experienced
with the reeds and with the drought; and the men often had to keep the
bags going out of their own scanty ration of water.</p>

<p>From the nature of the operations against the Turks, in which surprise
played so important a part, pipers had no opportunity of playing their
companies into action. So invaluable were they in keeping the men up in
the long desert marches that they were, as far as possible, reserved for that
duty.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">THE PIPE BAND OF THE 52nd (LOWLAND) DIVISION</span></h3>

<p>This band was formed in Gallipoli in October, 1915.</p>

<p>It was understood then that a dull and dreary winter campaign was in
front of the troops. A committee of officers was formed to find some sort
of entertainment to keep the men as cheery as possible. It was decided
that both a Military and a Pipe Band should be raised. This job was left
entirely in the hands of Colonel <span class="smcap">C. A. H. Maclean</span> of Pennycross, a critical
and enthusiastic lover of music, who, being a Highlander and an accomplished
piper, naturally insisted on the Pipe Band being a good one.</p>

<p>Practically all that was left of the pipers in the different regiments of
the Division were used to form the band, which consisted of twelve pipers
and six drummers, all having taken part in the severe fighting prior to this
duty. Good players and members of some of the finest bands in Scotland,
under the leadership of Pipe-Major Wm. Fergusson, 1/7th Battn. Highland
Light Infantry, a well-known piper and exponent of "Ceol Mhor," the
band made steady progress, and soon was in grand fettle. The way both
bands were appreciated testifies to the sound judgment of the committee
and the able management of the Colonel.</p>

<p>The Division, being entirely composed of Scots, hailed with delight the
skirl of the pipes, which had been heard but too seldom since the Division
landed.</p>

<p>The band had exceptional luck while on Gallipoli, never having had a
casualty after it was raised, although often playing under heavy shell fire.
They played and warmed the hearts of all true Scots, and must have given
the wily Turk quite a shock with "Hey Johnnie Cope," which could be
heard quite distinctly on a quiet morning in the firing-line, right up till
within a few days of the final evacuation of the peninsula.</p>

<p>After sojourning for a month on the Island of Mudros, they sailed with
the rest of the Division for Egypt. From Abbassia (Cairo) they moved
to the desert front, and have been with the Division in the trek across Sinai.</p>

<p>From El Arish the band accompanied the Division right into Palestine,
and is believed to be the first pipe band to play in the "Holy Land."</p>


<h3>PRISONERS OF WAR BAND</h3>

<p>One of the most remarkable of military pipe bands was one organised
in the British prisoners' internment camps in Holland. At one time this
band consisted of 13 pipers of different units, including two pipe majors,
under Pipe Major Duff, 2nd Royal Scots.</p>

<h3>PRINCESS PATRICIA'S CANADIAN LIGHT INFANTRY</h3>

<p>The pipers were mainly employed as bearers.</p>

<p>In the attack on the Vimy Ridge on 9th April, 1917, the battalion was
played over by the nine pipers.</p>

<p>Pipers were also employed as runners.</p>

<h3>THE CANADIAN SCOTTISH</h3>

<p class="p1 center"><span class="smcap">16th Battalion</span></p>

<p>At Ypres (April 1915) two pipers, Jas. Thomson and W. M'Ivor, were
killed while playing the charge; and at Festubert in May, G. Birnie and
A. Morrison were killed in the same way. Some of the pipers were employed
as bearers, runners, etc., but, the casualties continuing, it was found necessary
for a time to withdraw them from the firing line. During the Somme
fighting, however, they were again used as pipers. In the attack of 8th
October, 1916, Pipers Richardson, Park, Paul and M'Kellar played through
very heavy fire for over half a mile, and Richardson and Park were killed.
Piper Richardson was awarded the V.C. posthumously. On another
occasion, in the attack on the Quirique Rue position, Pipers Birnie and
Morrison stood on a ruined farmhouse and played until they were both killed.</p>

<p>In the attack on the Vimy Ridge on 9th April, 1917, the battalion was
again led to their objective by the Pipe Major, Groat and five pipers for a
distance of over a mile; Pipe Major Groat got the Military Medal.</p>

<p>For bravery at Paschendaele, Aug. 1917, Lance-Cpl. M'Gillivray&mdash;who
was killed&mdash;got the Military Medal, and Piper Paul received the same
distinction.</p>

<p>The C.O. regards the pipes as invaluable in action. Of the pipers one
got the V.C., one the D.C.M. and nine the Military Medal. No man was
recommended for a distinction unless he had twice played his company to
an attack.</p>

<p>Piper Telfer played his company into action at Vimy Ridge until
wounded. He was awarded the Military Medal; Piper W. Brand also got
the same distinction. Again, at Amiens, August 1918, the battalion was
played over. There was great competition among the men to be allowed
to perform this duty. Frequently they were employed as bearers.</p>

<h3>THE SOUTH AFRICAN SCOTTISH</h3>

<p>The pipers proved quite invaluable on the long marches in the
operations against the Senussi, in keeping the men going, under the most
trying climatic conditions.</p>

<p>The pipers were sometimes employed as bearers, or as carriers of stores,
ammunition, etc., and as runners.</p>

<p>In the Cambrai advance by the Germans they had to serve in the ranks.
At Houdincourt, having piled their pipes and taken up rifles, nearly all their
instruments were destroyed by a shell.</p>

<h2><a name="CANNTAIREACHD" id="CANNTAIREACHD"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CANNTAIREACHD</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Major J. P. Grant, M.C., Yr. of Rothiemurchus</span></p>

<p class="noindent">It is related<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> by Sir John Graham Dalyell how in 1818, one John Campbell
from Nether Lorn, brought "a folio in MS., said to contain numerous
compositions," for the inspection of the judges at the annual piping competition
held in Edinburgh under the auspices of the Highland Society:
the story goes on, "but the contents merely resembling a written narrative
in an unknown language, nor bearing any resemblance to Gaelic, they
proved utterly unintelligible. Amidst many conjectures relative both to
the subject and the language, nobody adventured so far as to guess at either
airs or pibrochs." It is believed that this is the earliest authentic reference
to the pipers notation known as Canntaireachd, and it is of interest
to note that even as early as 1818,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> among the class of Highland gentlemen
who acted as judges at the biggest competition in the country, the very
existence of the notation was unknown. Sir John mentions also that
he made later attempts to acquire this MS. volume and to trace two others
in the possession of John Campbell's father: his attempts were unsuccessful.</p>

<p>In 1828 Captain Macleod of Gesto published some pipe tunes in Canntaireachd
as taught by the MacCrimmons in Skye. The merits of this
publication have been made the subject of controversy among pipers and
others; this controversy has no place in this paper. The late John Campbell
(Iain Ileach) of <cite>Tales of the West Highlands</cite>, wrote a monograph on Canntaireachd
in 1880, in which he reviewed Gesto's book: the monograph,
interesting as it is and written in Iain Ileach's easy flowing style
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>is extraordinarily disappointing. In spite of his comprehensive knowledge
of folk-lore&mdash;more particularly of Gaelic folk-lore&mdash;he fails to indicate
any probable source of this notation&mdash;probably no one in Europe was,
or is better fitted to make conjectures on the point. However, he made two
statements of interest in the late history of the notation, (1) that he had
"often seen my nurse John Piper reading and practising music from an old
paper manuscript, and silently fingering tunes. I have tried to recover this
writing, but hitherto in vain," and (2) that there were three local varieties
of the notation (<em>a</em>) MacCrimmon (<em>b</em>) MacArthur, and (<em>c</em>) Campbell of Nether
Lorn. Now "John Piper" was this same John Campbell of the family of
Nether Lorn, which possessed three MS. volumes of Canntaireachd.</p>

<p>Among the older-fashioned pipers in Scotland, even just before the war,
one constantly heard syllables (hodroho, hiodro, etc., etc.) being used, generally
at haphazard, seldom in their correct place. The astounding thing is
that even fragments of a notation, the system of which had been out of
use for so long, should have survived to this day.</p>

<p>About 1912 two of the Nether Lorn MS. books were rediscovered, and
from them it has not been hard to reconstruct the system of notation. Those
tunes with recognisably the same names as we know them by to-day, furnished
the first step in the problem: after that it became easy to identify
other tunes with different names, and finally to rediscover a number of
tunes which have been lost for an undetermined period.</p>

<p>One word of caution will be necessary to certain pipers before going
further into this subject. This notation, invented for and suitable only to
piobaireachd, is not going to teach pipers how to <em>play</em> piobaireachd. There
is and always has been, one way and only one way to do that&mdash;to get instruction
from a master; once that is accomplished, a pupil may be fit to
learn more tunes by himself from books written in any intelligible notation.
This I take to be true of any musicians and any music.</p>

<p>The piobaireachd pupil might well get his instruction through the medium
of canntaireachd, for it has been made solely for this music, and is in point
of fact very suitable for the purpose. To begin with, if the few master-instructors
of piobaireachd will take the trouble (and assuredly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
it will not be great to them) to become familiar with canntaireachd, and
to use it as a medium of instruction, it is a matter of certainty that they
will realise its use for this end&mdash;for instead of a perplexing maze of notes
and grace-notes in staff notation to correspond to any movement which
they are trying to teach their pupil, they will have pronounceable vocables
which will act as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">memoria technica</i> to the pupil: the pupil will, at first,
learn these parrot style, until he gets to a certain length, when, unaided,
he will begin to see that these vocables he has learnt convey a definite
meaning&mdash;a definite combination of note and grace note, in a form which
can be crooned to the air. I have found that for the purposes of learning
new tunes, staff notation compared with canntaireachd is cumbrous and
misleading: and even when written in an abbreviated form (as in General
Thomason's great book, <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Ceol Mor</i>) it appeals mainly to the eye, while canntaireachd
appeals to the ear.</p>

<p>For some years now I have found it invaluable as a kind of musical
shorthand, and with a certain amount of practice it becomes possible to
write down a tune in canntaireachd while it is being played, and then to
learn it at leisure. I had the triumph of converting a brother piper a few
years ago. He was inclined to be sceptical about the whole system, so
to test me and it he played me a tune which I had never heard and I wrote
it down as he played it. After he had finished he said, "Now we shall
see what is in it, for I made two mistakes: play what you have got and we
shall see." I played on the practice chanter just what I had written, with
the mistakes, of course, included.</p>

<p>Again, when one is judging piobaireachd competitions, it is valuable as
shorthand to jot down notes of mistakes, etc.</p>

<p>Before coming to the notation itself, it should be explained that it is
not maintained for a moment that this variety (the Nether Lorn) is superior
in any way to the MacCrimmon or MacArthur varieties. It is merely given
and suggested for use, because it is this variety which has become once more
available to pipers at large. There are people who undoubtedly can do the
same for the MacCrimmon variety also, and it is sincerely hoped that they
will do so. That all three varieties are first cousins to each other is beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
doubt to any one who compares them; perhaps at a later date, when more
knowledge of canntaireachd becomes available, it may be possible to point
to one as the original, or to find a common ancestor to all.</p>

<p>Coming now to the actual notation, the following paragraphs should
be read, subject to this note that the pronunciation of the vocables must
be largely a matter of conjecture, but it is reasonable to suppose that, as
they were written in the manuscript and used by Gaelic-speaking pipers,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
the pronunciation should have at least some reference to Gaelic pronunciation&mdash;thus
the vowels, when occurring as the last letter of the syllable, would
be pronounced</p>

<p>By cadences I mean those notes often printed as grace-notes, GED,
followed by C, B, low A, or low G melody notes, and GE followed by D,
low A, or low G melody notes. The prefix 'hi' is in general terms used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
for this, <em>e.g.</em> hiharin, hihorodin. Taking them in above order, examples of
the vocables used are, of the former, hihodin, hihioem, hihinbain, and hihambam,
and of the latter hiaen, hienem, hiemto. It is one of the remarkable
points in the MS. that these cadences are indicated to a far less extent
than is played by traditional players of modern times, and I am as yet
unable to make any deductions from the manner in which they appear
as to the style in which the MS. intends them to be played. To avoid confusion
between 'hi' as cadence and high G with A grace-note, it would
be better to use the alternative 'chi' for the latter.</p>

<p class="p1 center"><em>General</em></p>

<p>A study of the key will reveal various noticeable points, some of which
I will touch on here. It will be seen that some of the composite vocables
can be pulled to pieces into their component parts, <em>e.g.</em>, hiotroeo, hinbandre,
etc., while others can only be dissected to a lesser extent, <em>e.g.</em>, hindaen in the
Tripling or Taorluath Breabach; in this latter case the vocable must be read
in its context, for hindaento might be <sup>G</sup>low A, D, low A, <sup>D</sup>B, while standing by
itself, but in conjunction with a string of others it is undoubtedly meant to
be the Taorluath Breabach. Again there is liable to be confusion between
'en' low A without any and with an E grace-note, and in some few cases it
is impossible to say definitely which is meant: on the other hand it is used
in the siubhal variation, and there can be no doubt in such a context:
hinen by itself is unambiguous, and in various combinations, <em>e.g.</em>, hiaendre,
it is highly probable that no E grace-note is intended. The question of the
eo and o, B or C, is a little more difficult in theory, but in practice it will
be found to narrow down to one or two instances; the most common instance
of this ambiguity is odro, which may be either B grip C, or C grip C. It
seems likely that this confusion is the origin of this difference in existing
settings of various tunes, <em>e.g.</em>, An Daorach Mhor (The Big Spree) Var. 1st
and doubling, The Battle of Auldearn, The Carles of Sligachin and many
others. Campbell often writes 'ho' for 'o,' obviously not intending a G
grace-note, but to avoid this ambiguity.</p>

<p>Time signature and rhythm are, I think, sufficiently shown to enable a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
trained player to find no difficulty in playing; bar divisions are indicated
by commas, and each part of each tune is divided into lines numbered
1st, 2nd, etc.: and a repeat is written at the end of the line to be repeated,
thus: Two times or twice over. '3 times,' etc., is often used in the MS.
to refer back only to the last comma, not to the beginning of the line. The
smaller details of time, which I will call "pointing," is a matter of greater
doubt. I have said above why I think Gaelic standards should be applied
to the pronunciation of the vocables, and my opinion is that the same applies
to this question in general terms: it can be said that as a rule the vocables
are separated into distinct words, the accent or stress (and in this case the
longer note) being represented as the first syllable of the word (an almost
invariable rule in Gaelic). Thus one gets hodarid hiodarid&mdash;not daridho
daridhio darid. Many exceptions can be pointed out no doubt, but the
above will serve as a broad rule.</p>

<p>It should be made clear to any reader of this paper that it has been written
in haste. Most of it is written from memory after four and three-quarter years
separation from MSS., books and notes, and I have no doubt that mistakes
will be discovered later. Further, it does not profess to be complete, for there
are some vocables not included, the meaning of which is not yet clear to me.</p>

<p>The two volumes of the MS. contain 169 tunes of which I can trace in
no other collection, printed or MS., 65 tunes: moreover, many tunes which
exist already in printed collections are written in entirely different settings,
and under different names from those known by present day players. To
illustrate this I have included at the end of this paper the MS. style of
An Ceapadh Eucorach (translated as the "Unjust Incarceration"). This
setting, apart from smaller differences, contains one line in each part which,
so far as my knowledge goes, is unknown to-day, and which in my opinion
is an essential part of the theme, leading the 3rd line up to the musical
climax of the ordinarily accepted 4th line.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The names of the tunes as
written in the Index or as headings in the MS. present a very difficult problem.
Some are in English; some are in recognisable Gaelic; some are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>in unrecognisable Gaelic, some give the first few notes of the tune, and some
are ludicrous mistranslations of Gaelic into English. Only approximately
42 out of the total have anything like the names by which the tunes are
known to-day.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that some day soon the whole MS. will be printed,
so that enthusiasts who have the time may really get to work and unravel
some of the conundrums which still remain so. I have a feeling that the
vocables used in so many Gaelic songs are distantly related to canntaireachd,
and research into this might conceivably throw light on the larger question
of the origin of canntaireachd. It would also be interesting to know of any
examples of similar notations in foreign countries. But the main thing
to be done by all pipers at the present day is to make real attempts to
discover other canntaireachd manuscripts: and the ideal should be that
all MSS. now known to exist or discovered at a later date should be made
available for comparison and information of other players; this is best
done by publication in as near the original form as possible, and failing that
by loan or gift to some responsible piping society, such as the Scottish
Pipers Society, The Piobaireachd Society, the Caledonian Pipers Society,
London, The Inverness Pipers Society, The Highland Pipers Society, Edinburgh,
or any other well-known society. This would ensure that the information
would get into the hands of those who can most easily disseminate it.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_IRISH_PIPES" id="THE_IRISH_PIPES"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE IRISH PIPES:</a><br />

<span class="fs80"><br />THEIR HISTORY, DEVELOPMENT, AND DIVERGENCE FROM THE
SIMPLE HIGHLAND TYPE</span></h2>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">W. H. Grattan Flood</span>, Mus.D., K.S.G.</p>

<p class="noindent">There is ample evidence that the bagpipe was used in pre-Christian Ireland,
whence it was brought to Scotland. It is referred to in the Brehon Laws
of the fifth century. Irish writers allude to it as <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Cuisle</i> and as <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Piob mor</i>&mdash;and
this is the warlike instrument which was adopted by our Scottish
brethren and became the national instrument of Scotland.</p>

<p>During the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries Irish pipers accompanied
the Irish troops that fought in Gascony and Flanders under King Edward I.
Strange, too, that Irish pipers were heard, in opposition to the Scots, at the
battle of Falkirk (July 22, 1298), and it is surmised that the strident tones
of the Irish <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">piob mor</i> suggested to the Scotch the employment of this warlike
instrument in battle. At Creçy (August 26, 1346) the Irish pipes were also
in evidence, and again at Harfleur (1418) and at Rouen (1419). Incidentally,
it may be stated that there is no sound historical evidence for the Scotch
bagpipes in battle at Harlaw (1411), but it would appear that they were
employed at the battle of Inverlochy (1431). Irish pipers were heard to
advantage in Henry VIII.'s Tournay campaign (1513) and also at the
siege of Boulogne (1544). This association of Irish pipers leading the charge
is strikingly pourtrayed in the <cite>Mask of Irishmen</cite> played before Queen Mary
at the English Court, on April 25, 1557, in which there were six Irish <em>Kerne</em>
and two <em>Bagpipers</em>.</p>

<p>Here is Stanihurst's description of the Irish <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">piob mor</i>, in 1575: "The
Irish, likewise, instead of the trumpet, make use of a wooden pipe of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
most ingenious structure, to which is joined a leather bag, very closely
bound with bands. A pipe is inserted in the side of this skin, through which
the piper, with his swollen neck and puffed-up cheeks, <em>blows in the same manner
as we do through a tube</em>. The skin, being thus filled with air, begins to
swell, and the player presses against it with his arm; thus a loud and shrill
sound is produced through two wooden pipes of different lengths. In
addition to these, there is yet a fourth pipe (the chanter), perforated in
different places (having five or six holes), which the player so regulates by
the dexterity of his fingers in the shutting and opening of the holes, that
he can cause the upper pipes to send forth either a loud or a low sound at
pleasure."</p>

<p>A few years after Stanihurst presented this description of the Irish
<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">piob mor</i>, a new development of this instrument came into vogue, that is,
about the year 1580, and almost immediately came into favour. This
development was the Irish <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Uilleann</i> (elbow) pipes, or domestic pipes, in
which the wind was supplied by a bag blown by the elbow. Shakespearian
commentators have been puzzled over the term "woollen" pipes in the
<cite>Merchant of Venice</cite> (Act iv. Sc. 1); but the great bard of Avon, who derived
much information regarding Ireland from Stanihurst and Dowland (if
he did not actually visit Ireland at the close of the sixteenth century), used
the Irish term <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Uilleann</i>, equating it with "woollen"&mdash;a corruption which
subsequently blossomed forth as "Union pipes." All during the seventeenth
century the <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Uilleann</i> pipes became immensely popular, and were
used as an accompaniment for dancing, especially the <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Rinnce Fada</i> (The
Long Dance), the qualifying word <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Fada</i> becoming Anglicised as "the
Fading," also alluded to by Shakespeare (<cite>Winter's Tale</cite>, Act iv. Sc. 3).
Subsequently keys or regulators were added, a feature that we also find in
the <em>Surdelina</em>, or Neapolitan bagpipe, in 1625, as described by Père Mersenne.
It is of interest to note that the great English composer, William Byrd,
<em>circâ</em> 1590, wrote a piece of programme music called "Mr. Byrd's Battle,"
in which there are three movements; the <em>Irish March</em>, the <em>Bagpipe</em>, and
the <em>Drone</em>. Thus the Irish bagpipe furnished the musical form known as
"pedal point" or "drone bass."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>When the Regiment of Irish Guards was formed in 1662, provision
was made for a drum major, twenty-four drummers, and a piper to the
King's Company. At the siege of Derry in 1689, the Jacobite regiments
had each fourteen pipers and eighty-six drums.</p>

<p>Further improvements in the <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Uilleann</i> pipes were effected between the
years 1700 and 1720, and, in consequence, they were taken up by musical
amateurs or "gentlemen pipers," of whom Larry Grogan, Parson Sterling,
and Walter Jackson were famous.</p>

<p>The Irish <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">piob mor</i> was heard at the battle of Fontenoy (May 11, 1745),
on which occasion the pipers played "St. Patrick's Day in the Morning,"
and "The White Cockade"&mdash;two characteristic Irish airs. Irish pipers
were also heard during the American War of Independence, and, in 1778,
Barney Thompson, from Hillsborough, Co. Down, was pipe major of Lord
Rawdon's "Volunteers of Ireland," which corps merged into the 100th
Regiment in 1780.</p>

<p>The revival of the Irish bagpipes in Irish regiments is due to Major
Doyle, in September, 1793. A few months previously, on May 23, his brother,
Colonel Doyle, in command of the 14th Regiment, found the fortunes of the
day at the siege of Famara going against the British troops, when, by a
happy inspiration, he ordered his band to play up the French revolutionary
march of "Ça Ira," and shouted to his troops: "Come on, boys, and
we'll beat 'em to their own damned tune." As a result, Doyle's regiment
successfully routed the French, to the strains of "Ça Ira," which has ever
since been the quick-step of the West Yorkshire Regiment (the old 14th).
The Colonel wrote to his brother the Major, who was M.P. for Mullingar,
telling him of the advantage of a good band, and, as at that very time
(August) Major Doyle had been commissioned by King George III. to form
a new Irish regiment, originally called "Major Doyle's Legion," the Major
recruited a gallant body of his countrymen, known as "The Prince of Wales'
Royal Irish Regiment"&mdash;with a band of Irish pipers.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards, in October 1793, Colonel de Burgh (brother of the
Marquis of Clanrickarde) formed the "Royal Connaught Rangers," with
a fine band of pipers and drummers. The Wexford Regiment (the 38th),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
commanded by Lord Loftus, had also a pipe band ere the close of the year
1794 or early in 1795. Several years later there were pipers attached to
the Tyrones (4th Inniskilling Fusiliers).</p>

<p>However, after the year 1815, the vogue of a pipe band in Irish regiments
waned, and it was not till 1903 that the Queen's County Militia&mdash;the 4th
Battalion of the P.O.W. Leinster Regiment&mdash;again took up the war pipes,
thanks to the enthusiasm and generosity of their commander, Lieut.-Col.
Lord Castletown, K.P.</p>

<p>To the Tyrone Fusiliers, a link battalion of the 27th Royal Inniskilling
Fusiliers, is due the revival of the Irish <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Piob mor</i> in 1859. Some years
later, Colonel Cox, commanding the 87th Royal Irish Fusiliers, supplied
eight sets of war pipes, as well as two drums, to eight Irish pipers in his
regiment. More recently, the 4th Battalion of the Leinster Regiment
(late Queen's County Militia) formed a pipe band under the direction of
their gallant Colonel, my dear friend, Lord Castletown of Upper Ossory,
K.P., who presented the pipes, in 1903. Since then all five battalions of this
regiment have pipe bands, mainly through the enthusiastic zeal of Captain
Orpen Palmer who published an excellent little book for the war pipes in
1913. Other Irish regiments having pipe bands are the 2nd Battalion of
the Dublin Fusiliers and the 3rd Battalion of the 18th Royal Irish.</p>

<p>In conclusion it may be briefly said that the Irish war pipe of to-day is
the same as the Scottish or Highland war pipe. On the other hand, the
Irish <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Uilleann</i> pipes may be regarded as a miniature organ. The old war
pipe is only capable of eight notes with certain limitations, whereas the
<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Uilleann</i> pipes are of two full octaves, including chromatic intervals, and are
thus capable of performing most classes of music, added to which the four
keys of the regulator on the chanter make for a wonderful effect.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_TUITION_OF_YOUNG_REGIMENTAL_PIPERS" id="THE_TUITION_OF_YOUNG_REGIMENTAL_PIPERS"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE TUITION OF YOUNG REGIMENTAL PIPERS</a></h2>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">John Grant</span>, Pipe Major</p>

<p class="noindent">There is an establishment for the training of bandsmen at Kneller Hall,
Twickenham, known as "The Royal Military School of Music," where
regular soldiers are trained in a very efficient manner both in theory and
practice, for brass bands. Each pupil remains for a considerable period,
extending from one to three years, and not only do they become good performers
on the various instruments, but they qualify for the rank of bandmaster
in any regiment. A bandmaster holds the rank of a warrant officer,
and, in some cases, a commissioned officer.</p>

<p>Some months ago a colonial soldier asked the question in a Highland
newspaper why the pipe major in a Highland regiment did not also hold the
rank of a warrant officer. In fact pipe major is only an honorary rank.
In reality he is only "sergeant piper." It would be very interesting to know
the difference between the person in charge of the one band and the other.
When the regiment is on the march the one band leads the men as well as
the other. In fact many prefer a pipe band to a brass band on a long route
march. In a pipe band the pipe major has to train his pipers efficiently
in the performance of their music just the same as the bandmaster of a
brass band, and why should a pipe major not be raised to the rank of a
warrant officer along with his brother bandmaster? True it is that in
a brass band there are many instruments for the bandmaster to teach
and bring in in their proper places, in order to have a perfect band. But
then the pipe major has the same task in front of him in training a perfect
pipe band. In fact&mdash;if I may be allowed the analogy&mdash;in the case of a brass
band a bandmaster might have many glaring errors and flaws in instrumenta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>tion
and harmony in his band, and this is passed over by the average listener
but detected by the expert conductor. The brass band, from its construction,
has more scope for covering errors than the pipe band.</p>

<p>The regimental pipe band is so constructed that each performer must play
in perfect unison, with pipes all timed in unison, and every finger should be
lifted and laid down together, a thing which is much more difficult to do
than is the case with a brass band. The errors in a badly trained pipe band
are much more easily detected where every performer has to play in perfect
unison, than the errors in a brass band, where different instruments take
different parts.</p>

<p>The next important point is the bandmaster has been properly trained
in his profession at the "Royal Military School of Music," Kneller Hall,
but the pipe major in a pipe band has not had this coveted opportunity.
There is no school where pipe music is taught in theory and practice, and
that may be one of the chief reasons why the pipe major falls short of the
trained bandmaster. If a military school of piping were instituted by the
War Office, such an institution would supply a long felt want. The piper
could then be educated in piping, to understand music in theory, and be
instructed in practice on a sound basis and fixed system.</p>

<p>Few pipers in pipe bands, if any, are trained at the proper age, <em>i.e.</em>,
12-14-16 years, except in industrial schools, where they are in many cases
improperly taught. When the boy is young his fingers will do anything
because they are very supple, but at the age of twenty they become stiff
and set against perfect manipulation. At this age theory is picked up in a
masterly fashion, and the pupil is unconscious of difficulties in fingering,
which simplifies everything in the process of his training.</p>

<p>At no period in the history of our nation was there greater need for a
military school of piping than at the present moment. There are hundreds
of young pipers required to fill the places of those who have fallen in action.
As can be seen from the record contained in this volume many pipe bands
have suffered most heavily. In fact some have been entirely wiped out.</p>

<p>From experience of class-work in piping it has been proved that the
training of young pipers at the age of fourteen to sixteen years under a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
fixed system is an ideal method of creating good performers. Boys who have
never had a finger on the chanter before, are started in classes of from
eight to ten in number. This prevents them from making an improper use
of the chanter or creating bad fingering which, if allowed to go too far,
can never be got out of. Each pupil should be provided with a properly
made chanter, and all the chanters in the class should be of the same make
and correctly tuned, so that, while at practice in class-work, they are all in
perfect unison. If one or two improperly made and badly tuned chanters
are used in a class, this is the cause of two great evils. The performer's ear
becomes less sensitive to the notes in proper pitch; and it discourages the
training of a pupil to detect improper sounds and slovenly fingering. If
there are two or three chanters out of tune in a class of ten they prevent
the instructor from detecting errors in fingering.</p>

<p>The use of a properly tuned chanter tends to cultivate a good ear, whereas
if the ear is used to improper sounds it loses its power of detecting the
difference between what is real and that which is false.</p>

<p>In class-work it is hardly possible to get ten pupils with equal powers
of picking up tunes and correct fingering. The ear may be compared to
a machine which records musical compositions and sounds. In this respect
the perfect machine has already been found. The phonograph will record
and reproduce a tune in perfect form, but then it is only a reproduction,
whereas the musician has life and power to create new and original tunes.</p>

<p>Take the human ear. Where it is perfect it will record a tune with the
same accuracy as the machine; but, where the ear is defective, it will only
take in what it is capable of. In cases where there is only a slight defect
in ear, and where a pupil is somewhat slow at fingering, care must be taken
that the slow pupil is brought up in line with the smart pupil. This makes
the results in class-work equal. Many instructors of piping fail
because they overlook slovenly fingering. Each pupil must be made
to finger exactly. The slovenly player spoils the class and every band
into which he may go, so that, if a class is to be properly taught, each pupil
must come to know his class mate as a musician as well as a companion.
Each performer in a pipe band must form part of a machine, as it were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
which acts systematically as a clock, in order to give good results and render
a tune like one man. A properly trained class with a sufficiently long period
of training will, in time, finger together in a manner which is most surprising
as regards regularity.</p>

<p>As an example of irregularity in fingering, take for instance&mdash;one pupil
is playing in perfect time, one graces his note a little too soon and another
a little too late. This gives three different renderings as regards time, and
how could they become pleasing to the ear or ever attain regularity in time
or fingering?</p>

<p>"Patience is a virtue," and an instructor of piping must be imbued
with that qualification. Without patience there can be no climax, no perfection,
and no goal to aim at. One may compel a person to do work even
by punishment, but to compel a pupil to play the pipes would be hopeless.
If a pupil has to be forced to play an instrument against his will, the music
will be anything but pleasing to the listener's ear. Then it will lack expression,
the most important and wonderful thing in all musical performances.
To be successful as an instructor of piping one must first win the
hearts of his pupils, so that they will like and respect him; speak firmly
but kindly to them; enforce strict discipline and good behaviour; and conduct
his school just the same as all well-governed establishments of education.
One hour's instruction should be given at a time, and this should
be given by the instructor of the school himself. Although boys are boys,
they are sensitive to insult and degradation, and they will not accept tuition
from another boy, even although he is a good performer. It has been found
to be the case that intelligent pupils must have instruction from the proper
source, and, when one boy teaches another, their time is wasted and they
drift into slovenly and careless fingering. This constitutes a reason for
strict supervision on the part of an instructor himself in a school of piping,
so that the best results may be attained and good order and obedience
maintained.</p>

<p>In bagpipe music, theory is entirely neglected. The average piper is
able to read the names of the notes: G A B C D E F G and A, and he
plays from them and pays little attention to their value. They may be all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
crotchets, quavers or semi-quavers, for all he cares. In almost every case
the piper has already heard the tune played on the chanter, and the relative
value of the notes mean nothing to him. Then, one hears illegal syncopation,
<em>e.g.</em>, the taking of the value from the lengthened note and giving it to
the next one, which should be the shortest note in the beat, especially in
six-eight time. Then, in writing down an original tune without a knowledge
of the theory of music, the average piper is of no use.</p>

<p>Boys should be started on the chanter at fourteen to sixteen years of
age, and given a period of chanter practice of from six to nine months;
at the same time it is necessary to see that, from the very start, they are able
to read music at sight. Then, towards the end of nine months tuition in
practice, theory should be taught; then they make more progress than
they would at the very beginning of their training. Theory enables the
piper to put expression into his playing, and, in his turn, he can in time
take his place as a qualified instructor of piping.</p>

<p>One thing of great importance in piping and the training of young pipers
is the rate of speed at which they play. The regimental regulation pace
is 120 paces to the minute. This may be all very well with a brass band,
where the performer with his 120 paces to the minute has a curtailed, nipped,
or broken step, but in pipe music it is far different. Any one who has a
knowledge of the Highland bagpipe and its music knows that piping at the
rate of 120 paces to the minute is not pipe music at all. The great majority
of marches for the pipes are written in two-four and six-eight time.
Two-four time has a crotchet beat and six-eight has a dotted crotchet beat.
The beat in six-eight being a dotted crotchet is of longer duration than the
two-four or crochet beat. When both are played at 120 paces to the minute
they are more or less equalized and spoiled. Time must be given to the beat
note in six-eight to distinguish it from the two-four beat; hence, 100 to 105
paces to the minute in two-four time is good marching, and 90 to 95 paces
to the minute in six-eight time gives the proper swinging pace which the
men in a Highland regiment like. To adopt such a suggestion would give
time and expression to pipe music, differentiate the pace in one time signature
from another, and, above all, would tend to give more time for correct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
fingering and clear, distinct playing. A young piper who has only been
playing the bagpipes for about six months is very often spoiled for life as a
performer when he begins, at that stage, to play at 120 paces to the minute.
He is unable to get the fingering in in time. What he cannot find time
to finger is left out altogether, and then, worst of all, he becomes a slovenly
and incorrect performer.</p>

<p>The teaching of piping has always been placed on an unequal footing as
compared with brass bands in His Majesty's forces, and one wonders how long
it is to be allowed to remain so. It is absolutely certain that a Military
School of Piping would be a blessing to regimental pipe bands, and the
standard of performance could be raised to the highest point of perfection.
In times of peace many people single out the brass band as the apple of their
eye in the garden of music, so to speak, but let us <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Higlanders'">Highlanders</ins> mark time and
see what the great Highland bagpipe has done in war.</p>

<p>Many pipers have gone over the parapet playing the bagpipes and have
won laurels which can never be forgotten. Hundreds of pipers have fallen
in the great war to sleep their last sleep in the graves of heroes, after sounding
the triumphant charge. The bagpipe has lived in war in its majestic power
and splendour, and in peace it should not be allowed to die.</p>

<p>In war there is, to our Highland regiments, no music like that of the
great Highland bagpipe. Its notes inspire the men to victory, and the
glory of the results of the music of the <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Piob Mhor</i> with its fluttering pennons
has left a landmark in the history of the world's war.</p>

<p>The great Highland bagpipe is the hallmark of a race whose achievements
are second to none in the world. It has been played in every great battlefield
in the history of our nation, and the heroic deeds done by Highland regiments
inspired by its music deserve to be perpetuated in a lasting memorial.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SPIRIT_OF_THE_MACCRIMMONS" id="THE_SPIRIT_OF_THE_MACCRIMMONS"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE SPIRIT OF THE MACCRIMMONS</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Fred T. Macleod, F.S.A. (Scot.)</span></p>

<p>It was the year 1626, a memorable year in the history of the Western
Isles of Scotland, and singularly eventful in the history of Skye and of the
Dunvegan family. Sir Rory Mor MacLeod, warrior and statesman, patron of
Art, of Music and of Letters, and dispenser of lavish hospitality to rich
and poor alike, had died in the Chanonry of Ross an event "greatly deplored
among the Gael at that time." The ancient sea-gate of Dunvegan Castle
was opened, and into a waiting boat stepped Patrick Mor MacCrimmon,
the dead chief's hereditary piper, the representative of a line of pipers
almost as long as the line of MacLeod chiefs. Swiftly, yet silently, the
piper was rowed across Loch Dunvegan to Boreraig. MacCrimmon stepped
ashore and took from his servant the instrument which had on many occasions
cheered his beloved master. His heart could no longer contain its pent-up
emotion, and his frame shook with a violent outburst of grief. Then, with
head erect and firm step, he walked the remaining distance to the renowned
College of Pipers, the home of his family for many generations. The fingers
of a master player lingered for a moment lovingly on the chanter. In
swift succession there fell upon the ears of his pupils, themselves no mean
players of ancient piobaireachd, the arresting, appealing, plaintive notes of
"Cumha Ruaridh Mhoir," "Lament to Rory Mor."</p>

<p>To-day, cattle browse upon the site of the MacCrimmon College, within
whose walls instruction on the <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Piob mhor</i> had been given by members of the
MacCrimmon family to countless students from all parts. Thither too had
come the best pipers of Scotland to receive the finishing touches to a piping
education well-nigh perfect in itself, including representatives of the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
well-known piping families, MacArthur, Mackay and Campbell. <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'The musi '">The music</ins>
of the pipes is now seldom, if ever, heard on the plateau upon which in
former days many pipers were wont to assemble. Sassenach inhibitory
legislation followed by the unsympathetic action of the Highland clergy
combined in an attempt to stifle for ever the majestic notes of ancient piobaireachd,
and the free, independent, social temperament of the Children of
the Island. But, while the grass grows green on the spot where the college
stood, the memory of these master musicians is enshrined in the ancient traditions
of the island, in the MacCrimmon compositions preserved and played
to-day, and in the names of places in the vicinity of the MacCrimmon homeland.
The ancient castle, dating from the ninth century, is occupied to-day
by Norman Magnus MacLeod, the 23rd chief of his line, as it has been continuously
occupied by his forefathers, and among the relics carefully preserved
is an ancient set of MacCrimmon pipes. One can still enjoy the shelter
of "Slochd nam Piobairean"<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and he who desires to do so can honour the
dust of several members of the MacCrimmon family in the little burying-ground
at Kilmuir, overlooking Dunvegan Loch. Nay more, one may converse
with living descendants of the family within a stone's throw of
the home of their forefathers. The fame of the MacCrimmons will never
die so long as these features or the memory of them remains, and, when these
are no longer remembered, the honour due to these Kings of Pipers will be
enshrined in the music they have left behind them.</p>

<p>It is impossible in this article to do more than touch the fringe of an
almost illimitable subject. There are many controversial points into which
it is not desirable to enter, <em>e.g.</em>, the origin of the family name, the exact
period during which the MacCrimmons held their hereditary office, and the
"Cainntaireachd" invented and used by them. The old papers in the
castle are singularly silent in regard to the history of men so closely allied
with the fortunes of the Dunvegan family. The only two documents among
these papers, so far as I am aware, which bear upon the subject, are a lease
of the lands of Galtrigal in Skye to the MacCrimmons in virtue of their
hereditary office, and a rent-roll of the latter years of the eighteenth century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
which contains entries of payments made by MacLeod tenants, in the form
of a tax to assist a member of the MacCrimmon family in his declining
years. But while contemporary documentary evidence is practically unavailable,
tradition has preserved a great deal of interesting information.
While it may not be advisable to accept as accurate many oral traditions
of a country, we are entitled to rely to a considerable extent upon, and to
accept as generally trustworthy, Highland oral tradition, which every
student of Highland history knows was the common mode of preserving
what otherwise would have been long ago irretrievably lost. The office
of "Seanachaidh"<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> was recognized and honoured in leading Highland
families and, subject to the legitimate criticism that a Seanachaidh was
apt unduly to extol the virtues of those whose praises he sang and to decry
the virtues of rival families, we are entitled to draw upon this source of
information.</p>

<p>The first published account of the family known to me is Angus MacKay's
collection of <cite>Ancient Piobaireachd</cite>, or Highland Pipe Music, published
in 1838, which forms the basis of most, if not all, the subsequent published
references to the family. Dr. Norman MacLeod's account (in Gaelic) of the
MacCrimmons must also be mentioned, and of more modern date Dr. Fraser's
interesting book on the <cite>Highland Bagpipe</cite>. The Rev. Archibald Clerk
contributed an article worthy of notice in the <cite>New Statistical Account of
Scotland</cite>, and Fionn's <cite>Martial Music of the Gael</cite> contains some interesting
notes.</p>

<p>I regard, however, as the most authoritative contribution a series of
Gaelic articles contributed to the <cite>Celtic Monthly</cite> by the Rev. Neil Ross of
Buccleuch Parish Church, Edinburgh. Mr. Ross is one of our ablest Gaelic
scholars, and, having been born and brought up in the heart of the MacCrimmon
country, he has had the peculiar advantage of obtaining the
local traditions of the family at first hand, from old people practically all
of whom have passed away.</p>

<p>I am inclined to place the commencement of the MacCrimmon era
so far as their relationship with the Macleods of Dunvegan is concerned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
approximately as 1500, and the termination thereof as 1822. My reasons
for doing so are first that we find that in 1651 one of the family was publicly
acknowledged as the King of Pipers. In the old chronicle detailing this
incident the name of the piper upon whom this honour was bestowed is
given as John Macgurmen (MacCrimmon) which I believe to be a mistake
for Patrick MacCrimmon, he who composed the well-known port, "I gave
a kiss to the hand of the King." If the old adage is true that
it took seven years of a man's life and seven generations of pipers before
him to make a perfect piper, the date 1500 is by no means too remote.
Further, the traditional list of MacCrimmon pipers who held their hereditary
office is sufficiently long to bridge that period. Dr. MacLeod enumerates
seven successive members of the family, whereas Mr. Ross furnishes us
with twelve names inclusive of those mentioned by Dr. MacLeod. The
following is Mr. Ross' list:</p>

<div class="textcol pad4">
Finlay of the Breacan.<br />
Iain Odhar.<br />
Patrick Caogach.<br />
Patrick Donn.<br />
Donald Mór.<br />
Patrick Mór.<br />

<div class="textcol">
Patrick Òg.<br />
Donald Bàn<br />
Angus Òg.<br />
Malcolm.<br />
Iain Dubh.<br />
Patrick Mór.<br />
</div>

<p>It is outwith the scope of this article to deal with the MacCrimmon
genealogy, or to discuss in detail the different members of the family. Interesting
notes might be furnished concerning most of the men whose names
are enumerated above, and it might not be difficult for a skilled player
of pibroch, by a careful analysis of the MacCrimmon compositions, to assign
many of the extant compositions to the appropriate composers. I prefer
to gather together from the available sources known to me a few incidents
in the lives of three outstanding members of the family, Donald Mór, Patrick
Mór and Donald Bàn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>


<p class="p1 center">DONALD MÓR MACCRIMMON</p>

<p>We shall probably not be very far wrong if we regard the period during
which this piper lived as that embracing the concluding years of the sixteenth
century and the early years of the seventeenth. I realise that, in
so placing him, I lay myself open to the criticism that I post-date the period
of Patrick Mór's activities. Patrick Mór is regarded as the son of Donald
Mór, and it is probable that both father and son were in the service of Sir
Rory Mór. It is stated that, being a special favourite of his chief, Donald
was sent to Ireland to complete his musical education. There can be little
doubt that as Ireland was the early home of Celtic letters so she was the
early home of musical culture, and that the high degree of efficiency attained
by the MacCrimmons was, at least in part, due to the finishing touches
obtained by them in the sister island. We learn that Donald Mór played
before many of the nobility and gentry of the country and greatly distinguished
himself. Mr. Ross has an interesting note that Donald accompanied
his chief to Ireland in the reign of James VI., on the occasions when MacLeod
led his clan in battle, and that about that time Donald composed
"The Lament to the Earl of Antrim." Among the compositions attributed
to him are "The Macdonald Salute," "Welcome to Rory Mór," and "The
Salute of the Earl of Ross." Mr. Ross, whose knowledge of pibroch entitles
him to speak with authority, states that close analysis of Donald Mór's
compositions reveals the fact that he frequently used the lower notes of
the chanter, and that there is internal evidence that he possessed great
skill in changing from the low to the high notes.</p>


<p class="p1 center">PATRICK MÓR MACCRIMMON</p>

<p>It is generally agreed that Patrick succeeded Donald as hereditary piper
to the MacLeods of Dunvegan. He is generally admitted to have been the
most distinguished member of his race. His life was spent in the service
of Sir Rory Mór MacLeod, who succeeded to the chiefship in 1596, and who
died as stated in 1626. Under the protection of this powerful chief the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
practice of Piobaireachd received an impetus which is bearing fruit to-day.
The Scottish Privy Council, at a comparatively early date, struck a severe
blow at what was regarded as the despotic power of the chiefs by limiting
the number of the retinue each chief was entitled to gather round him.
An important member of that retinue was the person who held the office of
hereditary piper. In addition to the honour such an office carried, there
were certain material advantages <em>e.g.</em>, the freeholding of land and the right
to certain dues and liberties which were not lightly esteemed. As indicating
the dignified nature of the office, it may be mentioned that, included in the
chief's retinue, was the piper's man, whose duty it was to act as servant
to the piper and to carry his instrument for him when not in use.</p>

<p>To Patrick Mór MacCrimmon is assigned the honour of having composed
the largest number of pipe tunes. In the plaintive lament "Cumha na
Cloinne" (Lament to the Children) he gives expression to his deep grief
caused by the visitation of one of the most poignant afflictions known to
man&mdash;the deaths of his children. According to Dr. MacLeod he was the
father of eight stalwart sons. Proudly one Sabbath morning he and they
marched to the church in their native glen. Before the close of that year
he mourned the loss of all his sons who died in an epidemic of fever. Two
other well-known laments, the composition of which is assigned to him, are,
"The Lament to the only Son" and "The Lament to John Garbh MacGhille
Chalum of Raasay," who was drowned in 1646 while crossing the Minch.</p>

<p>In 1651 Patrick Mór MacCrimmon was in all probability an old man,
but not too old to accompany the clan in support of Charles II. At this
time MacLeod of MacLeod was a minor, and the command of the clan
devolved upon his uncles, Norman MacLeod of Bernera and Roderick MacLeod
of Talisker. According to Angus Mackay's account, both these men
were knighted by Charles II. before the battle of Worcester in 1651 and
on that occasion, Patrick Mór having had the honour of playing before the
King, and his performance having greatly pleased His Majesty, Patrick
received the further honour of being allowed to kiss the King's hand. Mackay
states that the well-known port, "Fhuaireas pog o spog an Righ," was
composed by MacCrimmon in honour of the distinction then conferred upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
him. Various accounts of this outstanding MacCrimmon honour have been
published, no two of which entirely agree. Dr. William Mackay of Inverness
has frequently rendered signal service in the department of Highland
history, and I am indebted to his labours and scholarly research for what I
regard as a complete elucidation of the circumstances surrounding the composition
of this tune. Dr. Mackay edited <cite>The Chronicles of the Frasers</cite>,
an old MS. of events embracing the period 1616-1674. There are many
MS. histories bearing upon Highland matters, some of which have been
fabricated, but no suggestion of falsification besmirches the reputation
of this MS., which has been published under the auspices of The Scottish
History Publication Society. Referring to the year 1651, the date of the
battle of Worcester, the MS. states that at Stirling, in the month of May,
"there was great competition betwixt the trumpets in the army; one
Axell, the Earle of Hoome's trumpeter, carried it by the King's own decision.
The next was anent the pipers; but the Earle of Sutherland's domestick
carried it of all the camp, for non contended with him. All the pipers
in the army gave John Macgurmen (MacCrimmon) the van, and acknowledged
him for their patron in chief. It was pretty in a morning (the King) in
parad viewing the regiments and bragads. He saw no less than eighty
pipers in a crould, bare-headed, and John Macgurmen in the middle covered.
He asked what society that was? It was told his Majesty&mdash;'Sir, yow
are our King, and yonder old man in the middle is the Prince of Pipers.'
He cald him by name and comeing to the king, kneeling, His Majesty
reacht him his hand to kiss; and instantly played an extemporanean port,
'Fuoris Pooge i spoge i Rhi'&mdash;I got a kiss of the King's hand&mdash;of which
he and they were all vain." The writer of the manuscript has made an
attempt to render the Gaelic phonetically, and Mr. Mackay in a footnote
gives the correct Gaelic spelling "Fhuaireas pog o spog an Righ."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>


<p class="p1 center">DONALD BAN MACCRIMMON</p>

<p>MacLeod of Dunvegan, when Prince Charles Edward made his romantic
if impossible attempt to seize the crown of his forefathers, declined to lend
his services to the Prince, and consequently incurred the deep displeasure
of many of his clansmen. Had he remained simply neutral, the resentment
which his refusal to follow the Prince aroused would have been less bitter,
but he openly supported the reigning house. Opinions differ as to which
of two men, Malcolm MacCrimmon and Donald Ban MacCrimmon, held
the office of hereditary piper, but most authorities agree that Donald Ban
performed the duties of the office when MacLeod led out his men against
the Prince. Many of the MacLeod men refused to follow their chief, and
preferred to follow the standard of the Prince, under the leadership of the
heads of cadet families sprung from the Dunvegan line. MacLeod's position
was a difficult one. Had the Prince landed in Moidart with sufficient money,
equipment and arms, MacLeod would probably have given him all the
support within his power. It is persistently stated that his was one of the
signatures to the document inviting the Prince to raise his standard in
Scotland. In these circumstances it was necessary for MacLeod, by some
overt act, to give practical evidence to the Government of his non-adherence
to the Stuart cause. He was in close correspondence with, and being actively
advised by, President Forbes, who realised the importance of securing the
services of MacLeod, thereby lessening the likelihood of the Macdonalds
of Skye joining the Prince's forces. MacLeod gathered around him a substantial
body of men who held the lands in the vicinity of the castle, and
led them from the castle to the shore, where boats waited to convey them
to the mainland, and thence to the east of Scotland.</p>

</div>

<p>We are constantly reminded of the romance of the Forty-Five. We too
often forget the dark tragedies of those days. The spectre of looming
disaster entered the home of the MacCrimmons. Donald Ban MacCrimmon
had heard the note of the Banshee presaging a journey from which for him
there would be no returning. He was told to inspirit the men by the rousing
strains of "MacLeod's March," but true to his hereditary instincts he could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>only play a port in harmony with the mood of the moment. In place of
the "March" his pipes attuned themselves to that most touching of all
laments, "Cumha Mhic Cruimein." The pages of the <cite>Brahan Seer</cite> do not
contain any instance of second sight more circumstantially fulfilled than that
concerning Donald Ban MacCrimmon. Contemporary history supplies us
with the information. The scene is changed from Dunvegan Castle to
Moy Hall, the residence of The Mackintosh, a few miles east of Inverness.
In the absence of her husband, the wife of The Mackintosh, better known
as "Lady Anne," kept a watchful eye, in the interests of the Prince, on the
movements of his enemies. The Prince had accepted the hospitality of
Moy Hall for the night. News reached "Lady Anne" that a body of men,
under Lord Loudon, including MacLeod and his men, were to attempt to
capture the Prince under the cover of night. "Donald Fraser, a blacksmith,
and other four with loaded muskets in their hands were keeping watch
upon a muir out some distance from Moy towards Inverness. As they were
walking up and down they happened to spy a body of men marching towards
them, upon which the blacksmith fired his piece and the other four followed
his example. The laird of MacLeod's piper (reputed the best at his business
in all Scotland) was shot dead on the spot. Then the blacksmith (Fraser)
and his trusty companions raised a cry (calling some particular regiments
by their names) to the Prince's army to advance, as if they had been at
hand, which so far imposed upon Lord Loudon and his command (a pretty
considerable one) and struck them with such a panic, that instantly they
beat a retreat and made their way back to Inverness in great disorder,
imagining the Prince's whole army to be at their heels."</p>

<p>Tradition states that Donald Ban's body was buried not far from the
spot where he received his fatal wound, and I am informed that a large stone
on the moor marks the place of interment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>


<p class="p1 center">THE HOMELAND OF THE MACCRIMMONS</p>

<p>Pipers throughout the world will probably welcome a short description
of that part of Skye which will for all time be associated with the MacCrimmon
family. We may safely assume that the lands of Galtrigal and
Boreraig have undergone little physical change during the last 300
years. Standing on a lofty plateau, the MacCrimmon practice ground,
we find ourselves in the centre of a district possessing great natural charm
and an unparalled sea view. Dunvegan's ancient towers are a prominent
landmark reminiscent of bloody feuds, when Macdonald and MacLeod,
though connected by marriage, were continually at one anothers throats.
Johnson, Boswell, Pennant and Sir Walter Scott all testify to the hospitality
they received within its walls. Dun Boreraig, to the east, one of many
interesting brochs on the island&mdash;silent witnesses to the strength and ingenuity
of a past race&mdash;still keeps its sentinel watch. To the west stand out in strong
relief the rocky cliffs of Dunvegan Head, and in the south are the marvellous
Coolins with their ever-changing aspects. At the time when Angus Mackay's
publication appeared in 1838, the ruins of the "college" remained <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in situ</i>,
disclosing thick walls, massive cabers or rafters, and other characteristics
of old Highland habitations. Mackay says that the building was divided
into two parts, one forming the class-room and the other the sleeping apartments.</p>

<p>It was the practice of the MacCrimmons to enter into formal indentures
of apprenticeship with their pupils, one of which has been published in the
Inverness Gaelic Society's Transactions. So many years of study were prescribed,
regular lessons were given out, and certain periods for receiving the
instructions of the master were fixed. The Rev. Archibald Clerk, son-in-law
of Dr. Norman MacLeod (Caraid nan Gaidheal), writing in 1845 states, that
the whole tuition "was carried on systematically as in any of our modern
academies; and the names of some of the caves and knolls in the vicinity
still point out the spots where the scholars used to practice respectively
the Piob Mhor or large bagpipe, before exhibiting in presence of the master.
MacLeod endowed this school by granting the farm of Borreraig to it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
it is no longer than seventy years since the endowment was withdrawn.
The farm had originally been given only during the pleasure of the proprietor.
For many ages the grant was undisturbed, but when the value of
land had risen to six or seven times what it was when the school was founded,
MacLeod very reasonably proposed to resume one half of the farm, offering
at the same time to MacCrimmon a free lease of the other half <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in perpetuam</i>:
but MacCrimmon, indignant that his emoluments should be curtailed,
resigned the whole farm and broke up his establishment, which has never
been restored."</p>

<p>Any description of the home of the MacCrimmons would be incomplete
without referring to Clach MacCrimmon, a stone which is almost as well-known
as the MacCrimmons themselves. Although the account of this
matter savours of exaggeration, there can be little doubt that the incident
is believed in firmly by the people of the district. The incident as narrated
to me was as follows: One of the MacCrimmons was in the habit of tethering
his horse, in accordance with the custom of the country, by a rope attached
to a cipean driven into the ground. Some maliciously disposed persons
removed the cipean from its place on more than one occasion, thus causing
MacCrimmon's horse to roam and to do damage to the surrounding crops.
In exasperation, MacCrimmon vowed that he would so fix the cipean that
no mortal man would ever remove it again. He thereupon looked about
for a stone sufficiently large to suit his purpose, and, observing one
about 200 yards distant, he immediately proceeded, unaided, to lift it,
carried it that distance and placed it upon the top of the cipean. The
spot from which MacCrimmon removed the stone, and the spot upon which
he placed it, were both pointed out to me. The stone is about 3 feet long
by 2½ feet broad, and 2 feet high. I endeavoured to lift the stone an inch
or two from the ground and failed to do so. To satisfy certain south-country
sceptics, not very long ago, several men, including Murdoch MacLeod
(who accompanied me upon the occasion to which I have been referring),
succeeded in removing the stone from the bed in which it had lain so long,
and by using a wall as a lever, rolled it down a gradient of several yards
to the spot where it at present lies. A most remarkable sequel followed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
It was stated to me, in all seriousness, that underneath the stone when
it was removed, was found an ancient rusty cipean much worn away. Murdoch
Macleod stated to me that he not only saw it, but handled it.</p>


<p class="p1 center">MACCRIMMON PUPILS</p>

<p>If the genius of a master can be measured by the success of his pupils,
then, apart from other considerations, the MacCrimmons of Boreraig must
truly be regarded as kings among pipers. The fame of their college, long
recognised throughout the Isles, spread to the mainland, and pupils from
all parts of Scotland eagerly travelled long distances to avail themselves
of the tuition the college afforded. No piper's education was regarded as
complete until he had passed through the hands of the masters at Boreraig.
Rival chiefs buried for a time their jealousies, and sent their pipers to the
college on MacLeod's lands. The method usually adopted was to apprentice
the young pipers to the MacCrimmons for a period of years, and, in the case
of those men who had already otherwise been trained, to send them to
Skye for a short period. In a series of articles upon the History of the Parish
of Kiltarlity, written by the Rev. Archibald Macdonald, I find the following:
"There is an indenture drawn up at Beaufort on 9th March, 1743, in which
William Fraser, tacksman, Beauly, is described as his Lordship's (Simon
Fraser, Lord Lovat) musician. The brother of this William&mdash;David Fraser&mdash;had
been educated by David Macgregor, his Lordship's piper. His
Lordship, however, was now to send David to the Isle of Skye to have him
perfected as a Highland piper by the famous Malcolm MacCrimmon, whom
his Lordship was to reward for educating the said David for a year."</p>

<p>It in no sense belittles the importance of the MacArthurs, who, as a family
of pipers, were second only in excellence to the MacCrimmons of Boreraig,
to state that the musical education of a member of this family, Charles, was
perfected by Patrick Og MacCrimmon. The MacArthurs were hereditary
pipers to the MacDonalds of the Isles and, like the MacCrimmons, had a
school for instruction in pipe music. Pennant, who visited the Hebrides
in 1774, was hospitably entertained in this building and listened to the play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>ing
of many pibrochs. He describes the building as consisting of four
apartments, one of which formed the hall set apart for students. Of Charles
MacArthur the following interesting incident is told. Sir Alexander Macdonald,
being at Dunvegan on a visit to the laird of MacLeod, heard the
performance of Patrick Og MacCrimmon with great delight, and desirous
if possible to have a piper of equal merit, he said to MacCrimmon one day
that there was a young man whom he was anxious to place under his tuition,
on condition that he should not be allowed to return until such time as he
could play equal to his master. "When this is the case," said MacDonald,
"you will bring him home and I will give you ample satisfaction for your
trouble." "Sir Alexander," said Patrick, "if you will be pleased to send
him to me I will do all that I am able to do for him." Charles was
accordingly sent to Boreraig where he remained for eleven years, when
MacCrimmon, considering him as perfect as he could be made, proceeded to
Mugstad to deliver his charge to Sir Alexander, who was then residing there,
and, where Iain Dall Mackay, Gairloch's blind piper, happened also to be.
Macdonald hearing of their arrival, thought it a good opportunity to
determine the merit of his own piper by the judgment of the blind man,
whose knowledge of pipe music was unexceptionable. He therefore enjoined
Patrick Og and MacArthur not to speak a word to betray who they were, and,
addressing Mackay, he told him he had a young man learning the pipes for
some years and was glad that he was present to say whether he thought him
worth the money which his instruction had cost. Mackay said if he heard
him play he would give his opinion freely, and he requested to be informed
previously with whom the piper had been studying. Sir Alexander told
him he had been with Patrick Og MacCrimmon. Then Mackay
exclaimed, "He could never have been with a better master!" The young
man was ordered to play, and when he was finished Sir Alexander asked
the other for his opinion. "I think a great deal of him," replied Iain.
"He is a good piper; he gives the notes correctly, and if he takes care he
will excel in his profession." Sir Alexander was pleased with so flattering
an opinion, and observed that he had been at the trouble of sending two
persons to the college that he might retain the best, and that now the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
man would play, so that an opinion on his merits might also be given.
Mackay observed that he must be a very excellent performer to surpass the
first, or even to compare with him. When Patrick Og (who acted as the
second pupil) had finished playing, Sir Alexander asked the umpire what he
thought of his performance. "Indeed, Sir, no one need try me in that
manner," returned the blind man. "Although I have lost the eyes of my
human body, I have not lost the eyes of my understanding; and if all the
pipers in Scotland were present I would not find it a difficult task to distinguish
the last player from them all." "You surprise me, Mackay,
who is he?" "Who but Patrick Og MacCrimmon," promptly rejoined
Mackay, and, turning to where Patrick was sitting, he observed, "It was
quite needless, my good sir, to think you would deceive me in that way,
for you could not but know that I should have recognised your performance
among a thousand." Sir Alexander then asked Mackay himself to play,
and afterwards he called for a bottle of whisky, drank to their healths,
and remarked that he had that night under his roof the three best pipers
in Britain. So much admired was Charles MacArthur for his musical taste,
that a gentleman in MacLeod's country prevailed on Malcolm MacCrimmon
to send his son Donald for six months to reside with MacArthur, not with
the idea of adding to his musical knowledge, but in order that he might
be improved by studying MacArthur's particular graces.</p>

<p>About the same time one of the MacCrimmons, better known as Padruig
Caogach (obviously not the Patrick Caogach No. 3 on Mr. Ross' list, if Mr.
Ross' order is correct), because of his habit of frequently winking, was endeavouring
to compose a tune. Two years had passed since the first two measures
of it had become known, and still the tune remained half finished. Poor
Patrick utterly failed in his frequent attempts to finish what he had begun
so well. Mackay succeeded where Patrick failed, finished the tune and called
it "Lasan Phadruig Chaogaich."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Annoyed because of Mackay's success,
or perhaps because of the perpetuation of his physical weakness, Patrick
bribed the other apprentices to hurl the blind Iain from a height of twenty-four
feet. Iain, however, landed on his feet without injury. The place in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
question was thereafter known as "Leum an Doill."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> It is said that the
completion by Iain Dall of Patrick's unfinished tune resulted in great praise
being bestowed upon the former, and gave rise to the saying, "Chaidh an
fhoghluim osceann Mhic Cruimein," <em>i.e.</em>, "the apprentice outstrips the
master."</p>


<p class="p1 center">MACCRIMMON LEGENDS</p>

<p>The legends associated with the MacCrimmons are numerous and interesting,
but I can only refer to one or two of them. The "Cave" legend
is well-known, and I make no further reference to it except to say that
variations of it are to be met with wherever piping has been practised.</p>

<p>Neil Munro, whose stories of the Hebrides are redolent of peat reek
and quaint Gaelic idioms, has used the following Breadalbane legend to
excellent purpose in his story of the Red Hand: Ross, an old Breadalbane
piper, in a fit of jealous rage, forced the right hand of his brother into the
fire until it became a charred lump, to prevent him becoming a better
piper than himself. Somewhat akin to this old tale is one concerning the
MacCrimmons. Although proud of the state of perfection to which they
had brought the art of piping, and while encouraging the dissemination of
their art by returning young men to their homes from the college at
Boreraig trained to a high degree of efficiency, they nevertheless retained
among the members of their own family certain movements known only to
themselves. They were rightly proud of the position they occupied, and were
jealous lest they lost it, even though the honour were to descend upon a
pupil of their own training. The story goes that a girl, friendly with the
MacCrimmons, acquired the knowledge of how a certain hitherto secret
combination of notes was accomplished and imparted the information
to her sweetheart, who was not of the MacCrimmon family. Upon this
fact reaching the ears of her family the drastic step was adopted of instantly
cutting off her fingers so as to prevent possible leakage of information in
the future.</p>

<p>In the beautiful Gaelic song, said to have been composed by Donald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Ban MacCrimmon's sweetheart at Dunvegan, one of the lines refers
to the wailing of the fairies when they heard that their friend was
leaving to return no more. These little people play no small part in
Highland legends generally, and we are therefore not surprised to learn
of the existence of the following MacCrimmon fairy legend. On one
occasion, when Dunvegan's chief was entertaining within his hospitable
walls a goodly company, including many representatives of the leading
clans, accompanied by their pipers, it was agreed that the pipers
should compete for the post of honour. MacLeod, as a good host, naturally
left his piper to come last. The competition went on, piper succeeding
piper, until there remained two, including MacLeod's piper, MacCrimmon,
to compete. MacLeod glanced in the direction where he expected to see
MacCrimmon preparing to acquit himself bravely, but to his annoyance
there was no sign of him. Calling a boy, a young MacCrimmon, to him,
he bade him search for and bring back MacCrimmon. In a short time the
boy returned with the tidings that MacCrimmon was hopelessly drunk.
The chief was plunged into the depths of despair with the certainty staring
him in the face of being disgraced in front of his guests in his own castle.
Seizing the boy by the hand, he whispered in his ear as the eleventh piper
stepped forward, "You are the twelfth piper from your chief." Realizing
the impossibility of the task imposed upon him the poor lad fled from the
hall and threw himself down upon the hillside bitterly bewailing the helplessness
of his condition. Suddenly there arose out of an adjacent hillock
a beautiful little fairy, who, doubtless realizing the importance of time,
handed to the lad a silver chanter and bade him play upon it. He did so,
and through the silent glen there floated music the like of which had never
before been heard by human ears. With a radiant countenance the lad
immediately returned to the hall and, as he entered, the last notes of the
eleventh piper were dying away. Proudly the little fellow lifted his master's
pipes, and to the surprise and merriment of the great gathering, took the
place just vacated by the previous piper. The virtues of the silver chanter
stood him in good stead and the looks of amusement quickly turned into
admiration, as there came from the pipes the notes of a master player.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>In my own youthful days I heard the following MacCrimmon story.
On the occasion of a great competition among the pipers held at Dunvegan
Castle, the leading MacCrimmon of the day and his nephew, to whom
MacCrimmon had imparted his whole store of knowledge, save one particular
tune, resolved to compete. The old master had specially refrained
from communicating this particular composition to his pupil in order that,
while priding himself upon the accomplishments of his own pupil, he might
yet retain one item, the knowledge and playing of which would secure for
him the coveted honour at the coming competition. On the night before
the great event master and pupil slept together at a certain inn. Believing
his companion to be sleeping, the old man conned over to himself the air
by which he hoped to distinguish himself on the morrow. The arm of the
apparently sleeping lad was lying stretched across the bed, and the old
piper's hands, mechanically searching for something upon which to "finger"
the tune, seized upon his pupil's arm. Time and again the old man practised
the notes, at the same time quietly humming the notes, ignorant of the
fact that his pupil, though feigning sleep, was very wide awake, and gradually
becoming the possessor of the coveted port. On the morrow the pupil
entered the lists before his master, and to the mortification of the latter,
carried off the leading honour by reason of his manner of playing the tune
of which MacCrimmon believed himself at that time to be the sole possessor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Once again, I find myself in "Eilean a' cheó." Six weeks of almost constant
rain, disappointing to others who are not accustomed to the vagaries
of the weather, have not chilled the affectionate ardour which contact with
the island and its people invariably inspires in me. The mists have ever
hung heavy on the hills in times of deep, heart-breaking sorrow, and the
present tempestuous weather is but in keeping with the sad aftermath of
War.</p>

<p>To-day, there came from a distant part of the Island one who served
his country well in the late war and who was sorely wounded in that service.
To the home of Pibroch he brought his pipes, and in the seclusion of the
Pipers Cave in Galtrigal he played two well-known MacCrimmon ports;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
"Cumha Ruari Mhor," and "Tog orm mo phiob." An ardent student of
MacCrimmon Pibroch, and a cultured exponent of their art, he came to do
honour at their shrine. It was fitting that one of those who heard the
haunting notes as they welled forth across the loch was Sir Rory's lineal
descendant Macleod of Macleod.</p>

<p>There are many pipers who look hopefully for the day when the
memory of the MacCrimmons and of their immortal genius shall be enshrined
in a College of Piping, where pupils from far and near may receive instruction
in all that is noblest and best in the art of bag-pipe playing.</p>

<h2><a name="A_GOSSIP_ABOUT_THE_GORDON_HIGHLANDERS" id="A_GOSSIP_ABOUT_THE_GORDON_HIGHLANDERS"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">A GOSSIP ABOUT THE GORDON HIGHLANDERS</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By J. M. Bulloch</span></p>

<p class="noindent">If the Great War has reversed some preconceptions and ruthlessly rationalised
many traditions, it has confirmed, and actually enhanced, the fine
fighting reputation of the ten Regiments of the Line&mdash;half of them kilted&mdash;which
Scotland contributes to the British Army. We now know of a certainty
that this reputation is well founded as we did not know it before.
True, there has long been a legend to that effect, but of recent years there
has been a disposition to question its validity. Scotland, or rather the
articulate part of it, has borrowed the deadly doctrine of self-depreciation,
from which the dominant partner has suffered severely, and the suggestion
has not been wanting that the praise of Scots troops, which received such
an impetus from the enthusiastic pen of the author of <cite>The Romance of War</cite>,
was somewhat overdone. We were reminded that our Army had not
had to face troops on the Continent of Europe since the days of the Crimea;
one Scots Regiment had not done so since 1799, while the Gordons had
nothing to show for it since Waterloo.</p>

<p>If that was true of the old "Contemptibles" generally, it was still
truer of the auxiliary forces, which had seen no fighting at all, except in
South Africa; but to-day all of them have stood the acid test of the greatest
war in history. The old "Contemptibles" were never finer, and we have
lived to see one of the best Divisions in the Army composed entirely of
kilted Territorials. Indeed, a cloud of witnesses has arisen to prove that
all the 126 Battalions, into which the 69 composing the Scots Regiments
expanded themselves for the purposes of war, have rendered magnificent
service. If we relied merely on the word of the Commander-in-Chief we
might suspect bias, for Earl Haig and more than one of his Generals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
are Scots by birth; but we have the appreciation of the special newspaper
war-correspondents, and not one of them hailed from north of the
Border.</p>

<p>We have, moreover, the testimony of the enemy, who very quickly
recognised the valour and skill of all the Scots Regiments, particularly
those of the 51st Division. Indeed, the Scots soldier, although he
represented only eleven per cent. of the British Army against eighty-one
per cent. of England itself, took hold of the imagination of the Germans
to such an extent that their caricaturists turned John Bull into a
Highlander, converting his traditional tall hat into a diced "cockit" bonnet,
his white riding breeches into a kilt or tartan trews, and his top-boots
into gaiters. The pages of <cite>Simplicissmus</cite>, <cite>Kladderadatsch</cite>, and <cite>Jugend</cite>,
to name only a few, have throughout the war pictured a long procession
of the "wife-men" as representing the British Army, at first in a
spirit of incredulous burlesque, and latterly with something of the wholesome
fear, which was popularly supposed to have overtaken George the Second
when he started in his sleep in terror as he dreamed that the "Great Glenbogged"
(Glenbucket) was swooping down upon him.</p>

<p>It was to the advent of the father of that monarch that we owe the
raising of the kilted Scots&mdash;nearly all the trewsed Regiments arose in the
previous century&mdash;though the connection was indirect, not to say inverted,
and was touched with an irony (especially in the light of the greatest of
wars), which has been largely lost on a certain type of popularly accepted
English history. According to this reasoning, the Highlanders, on seeing
the country in danger owing to the expansion adventures of the dominant
partner at the expense of France, flocked to the colours at the call of the
English Government, and thus not only helped to save the Empire, but
gratified their own passion for arms, which had been severely suppressed
after the Forty-Five.</p>

<p>The facts, however, are very different from this facile theory. To begin
with, if the country as a whole had little consciousness of expansion, as
Seeley argued, the Highlander had infinitely less, for one of the main troubles
of dealing with him, even in our own day, has been his homing instinct,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
his intense love of his native soil, no matter how poor it may be. In the
second place, the ambitions of the House of Hanover touched no responsive
chord in the Highlander's heart, for the Clans had felt the full scourge of
Teutonism in the ruthless work of Cumberland at Culloden.</p>

<p>Again, if France was the hereditary arch-enemy of the dominant partner,
Scotland in general and the Highlands in particular, had no such quarrel
with her. On the contrary, France and Scotland, linked together by racial,
psychological, and historical similarities and identities of interest, had long
been the best of friends, and it must have puzzled the average Highlander
why he should be asked to fight against her. So strong is this community
of spirit that it might very well be argued that the Highland Regiments
have never fought better in their long history than they have done in the
Great War, because they were fighting for France, as well as for their native
country.</p>

<p>No doubt the Union had placed Scotland in the same category as England
so far as France was concerned, but the kilted regiments arose, not so much
out of a political necessity as from a revival of the spirit which had made
the Scot in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries a soldier of fortune
wherever he was wanted, fighting now for Rome, and now in the ranks of
Gustavus Adolphus against her; fighting to a large extent without passion,
but as an artist in arms; and it was this absence of bias as much as anything
else that made these venturers clean fighters, and raised their reputation
as masters of their art wherever they took service.</p>

<p>From first to last the spirit which animated the soldier of fortune&mdash;out
to gratify his instinct for adventure, his desire to make a living, and his
passion for individuality&mdash;has always inspired the Highland regiments
to a remarkable extent. It is true that the war with France involved the
most momentous issues for the State, but the methods adopted for warding
off the danger were far more personal and local than national. It might
be argued that the real cause of the war with France was due to the imperialistic
ambitions of individual adventurers, and therefore raised little
national animus, but precisely the same methods of meeting a crisis coloured
the early stages of Armageddon, when every one felt involved, the influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
of one man, Lord Kitchener, being far more potent in rousing resistance
than any abstract doctrine of State necessity.</p>

<p>The raising of troops to fight France was at no time the complete State
undertaking that conscription has involved in our own day. At first the
duty was taken up by individual landowners, who raised in turn Regiments
of the Line and Fencible Corps; and when their pockets were exhausted,
the task was assigned to local authorities like the Lords Lieutenant,
who were commissioned to raise in turn Militia, Volunteers (1794-1808),
and the very curious force known as Local Militia (1808-1816).</p>

<p>Scotland afforded a splendid ground for the exercise of personal influence
because, although the Clan system with its chieftainship had broken down,
the influence of the great landowners was still powerful enough to attract
attention, although the devotion of the people had to be reinforced by
bounties on a scale unknown in our day, and by all sorts of practical recognition,
such as the adjustment of rents and the enlargement of holdings;
for, although the armies thus raised had strong affinities with the levies
organised under the feudal system, the Clan system was infinitely more
democratic, and gave scope for greater individuality. This is so true that
it often happened that the men raised in one glen declined to march to the
rendezvous with the men of another glen who happened to be their hereditary
enemies, and trouble arose over the demands of particular groups
to be led by their local officers, some of them even believing that they should
go forth to battle by Clans, as in the old days.</p>

<p>Of all the personal potentates interested in recruiting in Scotland, none
was more powerful than the fourth Duke of Gordon who, although long
in possession of vast tracts of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Higland'">Highland</ins> territory, was in no sense a Highlander,
his family having migrated from Berwickshire to the north, and the trouble
which existed for centuries between him and his Highland tenants, like the
Macphersons, was due to the inability of his ancestors, or their representatives,
to understand the true nature of the Celt. More motives than one
urged His Grace forward as recruiter. In the first place, his immediate
ancestors had played a very dubious part in the Jacobite risings, and the
fourth Duke was anxious to remove the last doubts as to the loyalty of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
house. Later on he married an extremely clever and ambitious woman,
the famous Jane Maxwell, who had a great desire to play a big part in the
State, and do something for her sons.</p>

<p>Whatever the motives, the recruiting achievements of His Grace were
splendid, for from first to last he raised no fewer than four complete regiments,
besides contributing two companies to corps raised by others,
and he also played a very active part as Lord Lieutenant of his county.
The forces organised by the Duke were as follows:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl wd20">1759-65</td><td class="tdl wd60">89th Regiment.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">1775-83</td><td class="tdl">Company for the Fraser Highlanders.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">1778-83</td><td class="tdl">Northern Fencibles.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">1790-1</td><td class="tdl">Company for the Black Watch.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">1793-9</td><td class="tdl">Northern Fencibles.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">1794</td><td class="tdl">Gordon Highlanders.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The sole remnant of this mighty effort, which must have cost the Duke
a fortune, is the regiment of Gordon Highlanders, which we have seen blossom
out into eleven battalions, to say nothing of certain reserves; and although
the regiment has not continued to be recruited on the ducal estates, its
connection with the House of Gordon has all along been maintained, and
has actually been strengthened in recent times. That connection of course
has always been symbolised by the wearing of the clan tartan, but the links
with the north were strengthened by the rearrangement of 1872, when
infantry regiments were allotted to definite Territorial areas for the purpose
of recruiting. About the same time the Gordon family motto, "Bydand,"
and the familiar crest were placed upon the bonnet in lieu of the hard-won
Sphinx.</p>

<p>What is of much more importance is the fact that the genius of the
family, admirably described in the alliterative phrase the "Gay Gordons,"
which inspired the original regiment, has passed into all its subsequent
accretions, so that the 75th Regiment added to it in 1881, although actually
of earlier origin, has been completely absorbed. The same can be said of
the old Aberdeenshire Militia, which became the 3rd Battalion, and also of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the various Volunteer Corps which were gradually absorbed, while the
Service Battalions raised by Lord Kitchener displayed exactly the same
spirit as the cradle corps. This continuity and identity of tradition are also
emphasised, not only in the Gordons, but in all the Scots regiments, and
especially in the kilted units, by the fact that they alone maintained
during the War at least, part of their Peace equipment in the shape of the
kilt&mdash;even if it was camouflaged with khaki aprons&mdash;and the trewsed
regiments had their glengarries replaced by Kilmarnock and other braid
bonnets.</p>

<p>Who can doubt that such a continuity of outward traditions is but the
symbol of a spiritual identity which links up the Scots regiments of the present
day with the Corps who did such splendid work of old from Fontenoy
to Waterloo, from the Crimea to South Africa. True, when you come to
define it, it is difficult to say what it precisely consists in. Nearly every
Regiment of the Line has its own peculiarities, but the Scots regiments
have them in even greater abundance, for with them they are reinforced
by marked racial characteristics. It is perfectly true that the Highland
regiments are no longer confined to Highlanders, or even to Scotsmen,
although the idea industriously propagated some years ago that they were
originally composed largely of Irishmen, is a fallacy, completely disproved
by War Office Records. Even if it were otherwise, the fact remains that
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> which all these idiosyncracies help to form has a remarkably
proselytising influence, very subtle and difficult to define, but very
potent in actual practice.</p>

<p>The early history of the Gordons is full of curious little incidents which
sometimes run counter to popular notions. For example, it used to be commonly
supposed, especially in support of the now exploded theory that
we have become "degenerate," that the first recruits of the Highland
regiments were gigantic men. This is far from being the case. From
the Description Book of the Gordons, one of the very few regiments which
possess such data in an early form, it is proved that the average height
of 914 men composing the greater part (940) of the original regiment, was
only 5' 5½", only six of them being 6' or upwards&mdash;the tallest, a Morayshire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
man, scaling 6' 4". Similar facts can be cited about the heights of other
groups of men at the same period.</p>

<p>There were only 16 men actually named Gordon, against 39 Macdonalds,
35 Macphersons, and 34 Camerons. As to the occupations of the men,
it is interesting to note that 442 were described as "labourers," and as
most of them came from the Highlands, they were presumably farm servants.
Of skilled artisans, 186 were weavers. Inverness-shire, where
the Duke had vast estates, supplied 240 men, Aberdeenshire 124, Banffshire
82, Lanark 62, Ireland 51, England 9, and Wales 2.</p>

<p>There was a solitary German in the regiment, a musician named
C. Augustus Sochling, hailing from Hesse Cassel. There was another German
in the regiment later on, also a musician, named Friederich Zeigher (or
Zugner) who fell at Quatre Bras. The appearance of these Germans was in
its way a sort of return for the fact that the House of Gordon had given
many good soldiers of its name to what we now call Germany, although
most of them really took post in Poland. The descendants of at least four
of these soldiers still exist in Germany, and have risen to the dignity of a
von, including the founder of the von Gordon-Coldwells, of Laskowitz, in
West Prussia, the von Gordons of Frankfort, and the family of Dr. Adolf
von Gordon, the well-known Berlin lawyer, whose motto is "Byid Dand."
Although at the beginning of 1914 he told a Berlin newspaper that he knew
nothing more about it than that it was an "altschottischer Spruch," it is,
of course, nothing more or less than the historic word "Bydand."</p>

<p>With regard to the pipe history of the regiment not very much is known.
I fancy this is due to the fact that so much that has to do with the art of
piping generally rests on oral and not written tradition. In the second place
it must be remembered that pipers were not originally recognised by the
State. They were purely a regimental, and not an Army, institution, and
had no separate rank as the drummers had. Indeed, it was not till about
1853 that they got the same rank and pay as drummers. Thus, in May
1805, a piper named Alexander Cameron was taken on the strength of the
Grenadiers as drummer, probably to get him drummer's pay, to which,
as a piper, he was not entitled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>The rivalry of the two is brought out in a story told in Carr's <cite>Caledonian
Sketches</cite>, of a dispute as to precedence between a piper and a drummer of
a Highland regiment. When the Captain decided in favour of the latter,
the piper expostulated with the remark, "Oh, sir, shall a little rascal that
beats a sheepskin take the right hand of me that am a musician?" The
differentiation of the two is still reflected in the fact that a piper is always
a piper, whereas a "musician" returns to the ranks in time of war.</p>

<p>The first direct mention of pipers in the Gordons occurs in a regimental
order of October 27, 1796, when the regiment was at Gibraltar, and when
it was ordained that pipers were to attend all fatigue parties. An interesting
sidelight on the use of the pipes occurs in a regimental order of November 12,
1812, when the regiment was at Alba de Tormes in Spain:</p>

<p>"The pibroch will never sound except when it is for the whole regiment
to get under arms; when any portion of the regiment is ordered for duty
and a pipe to sound, the first pipe will be the warning, and the second pipe
for them to fall in. The pibroch only will, and is to be considered, as invariably
when sounded, for every persons off duty to turn out without a
moment's delay."</p>

<p>A pathetic little story about this function of the pipers is told by James
Hope in his forgotten little book, <cite>Letters from Portugal, Spain and France</cite>,
printed in 1819:</p>

<p>"At ten o'clock (on the evening of the day of Quatre Bras) the piper of
the 92nd took post under the garden hedge in front of the village, and,
tuning his bagpipes, attempted to collect the sad remains of his regiment.
Long and loud blew Cameron, and, although the hills and vallies (<em>sic</em>) re-echoed
the hoarse murmurs of his favourite instrument, his utmost efforts
could not produce more than half of those whom his music had cheered in
the morning on their march to the field of battle."</p>

<p>At the battle of St. Pierre in the Peninsular, December 13, 1813, two
out of the three pipers of the Gordons were killed while playing the pibroch
"Cogadh na sith" (with which they were to charm the ears of the Czar
of Russia in the great Review at Paris in July, 1815). As one fell, another
took up the tune, and it was suggested to Sir John Sinclair, as President of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
the Highland Society, that this "should be made known all over the Highlands."
It may be noted that the Colonel, the gallant, if martinet, Cameron
of Fassiefern, who fell at Quatre Bras, gave great encouragement to his
pipers, especially as regards the specially Highland airs and the high-class
music (Ceol Mor). Colonel Greenhill Gardyne attributes to this the fact
that "all pipers in the Gordons are still taught to play Piobaireachd,"
and that the ancient and characteristically Highland class of pipe music
is still played every day under the windows of the officers quarters before
dinner.</p>

<p>The Gordons have enjoyed the services of one particular family of
hereditary ear-pipers, the Stewarts. They came from Perthshire, where
one of them was a piper to the Duke of Atholl, while his brother, known as
"Piper Jamie," crossed the hills into the Parish of Kirkmichael, Banffshire&mdash;the
cradle of a remarkable military family, the Gordons of Croughly&mdash;where
seven sons were born to him. All of these strapping fellows entered
the Aberdeenshire Militia, now the 3rd Battalion of the Gordon Highlanders,
six of them becoming pipers. The best known of these was the eldest,
Donald (1849-1913), who migrated to New Deer, Aberdeenshire, and was
known all over Scotland as a champion piper. The family has been supplying
pipers to the Gordons for more than half a century.</p>

<p>No doubt modern battles are not won by deeds of individual daring
such as these pipers have achieved, but they are won in terms of the spirit
which makes such conduct possible, for it is just the little things, the train
of tradition, the idiosyncracies of uniform, and the rest of it, which go to
form that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> which has made the kilted regiments famous the
world over.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MUSIC_OF_BATTLE" id="THE_MUSIC_OF_BATTLE"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE MUSIC OF BATTLE</a></h2>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">Philip Gibbs</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Through all the days and the years in which I served as a war-correspondent
on the Western Front, it was seldom that I did not hear, from near by or
from afar, the music of the pipes. It was a sound which belonged to the
great orchestra of life in the war zone, rising above the deep rumble of
distant guns, travelling ahead of marching columns up the long roads to
Arras or Bapaume, wailing across the shell craters of that desert which
stretched for miles over the battlefields of Flanders, and coming to one's
ears like elfin music through the dead woods above the Somme. Before
every big battle the skirl of the pipes went with the traffic of war and guns
surging forward to the fighting-lines. For in every big battle there were
Scottish troops and their pipers played them on to the fields of honour,
and played them out again when their ranks had been thinned by heroic
sacrifice. This music had an inspiring influence not only on the Scottish
troops themselves, whose spirits rose to the sound of it when, after long
marching, their feet were leaden on the hard roads and their shoulders
ached to the burden of their packs, but also on English troops who were
in their neighbourhood, and on their way to the same battlegrounds. For
though an Englishman cannot, as a rule, distinguish one tune from another&mdash;does
not indeed believe that the pipes play any tune&mdash;there is something in
the rhythm, in the long drawn notes, in the soul singing out of those "wind-bags,"
so he calls them, which in some queer magic way, stirs the blood of
a man, whoever he may be, and stiffens the slackening fibre of his heart,
and takes him out of the rut of his earth to some higher plane of thought,
and gives him courage. It is an Englishman who writes this, but I am sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
of it, for many times in dark days of war I have been taken up by the sadness
and the gladness of the pipes, borne by the breeze across the fields of
war.</p>

<p>The 15th (Scottish) Division were special friends of mine, and I remember,
years ago now, how I saw them marching through Bethune on their way
to the battle of Loos, where they fought their first big fight in September
of '15. Through the Grand-Place of Bethune, not yet wrecked by shell-fire,
they came marching with their guns. Snow was falling on the steel
helmets of the men and clinging to the long hair of their goat-skin coats.
It was a grim scene, and away beyond the city of Bethune there was the
ceaseless thunder of bombardment over the enemy lines. But above this
noise, like a heavy sea breaking against rocks, rose the music of the Scottish
pipers playing their men forward. One pipe band stood in the Square, and
its waves of stirring sound clashed against the gabled houses, and I remember
how all our English gunners, riding with their heads bent against the storm,
turned in their saddles to look at the pipers as they passed and seemed
warmed a little by the spirit of that Scottish march.</p>

<p>The 15th Division went into battle with their pipers, while the Londoners
of the 47th had to be content with mouth-organs and sing "Who's your lady
friend?" on the way to Loos through storms of shell-fire. The 10th Gordons
were the first into the village of Loos, and some of them went away to the Cité
St. Auguste&mdash;and never came back. It was an unlucky battle and cost us
dearly, but it proved the immense valour of our men, who were wonderful.
The pipers played under fire and some of them were badly wounded, but there
were enough left to play again when the Scots were relieved and came out,
all muddy and bloody, with bandaged heads and arms, to small villages
like Mazingarbe and Heuchin, where I saw Sir John French, then Commander-in-Chief,
riding about on a white horse, and bending over his saddle to
speak to small groups of Jocks, thanking them for their gallant deeds.</p>

<p>In the early battles of the Somme there were many Scottish battalions
of the 3rd and 9th and 15th Divisions, fighting up by Longueval and Bazentin
and Delville Wood, where they suffered heavy losses under the frightful
fire of German guns. The South African Scottish were but a thin heroic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
remnant when they staggered out of the infernal fire of "Devil's Wood,"
and the men of the 15th Division who captured Longueval left many of
their comrades behind. That was one of the finest exploits of the war,
and they were led forward by their pipers, who went with them into the
thick of the battle. It was to the tune of "The Campbells are Coming"
that the Argyll and Sutherlands went forward, and that music which I
had once heard up the slopes of Stirling Castle when the King was there,
was heard now with terror by the German soldiers. The pipers screamed
out the Charge, the most awful music to be heard by men who have the
Highlanders against them, and with fixed bayonets and hand grenades
they stormed the German trenches, where there were many machine-gun
emplacements, and dug-outs so strong that no shell could smash them.
There was long and bloody fighting, and in Longueval village, across which
the Highlanders dug a trench, the enemy put down a barrage, yard by
yard, so that it was churned up by heavy shells. On that day of July
20, 1916, I met the Scots marching out of that place. They came across
broken fields where old wire lay tangled and old trenches cut up the ground,
and there was the roar of gun-fire about us. Some of our batteries were firing
with terrific shocks of sound which made mule teams plunge and tremble,
and struck sharply across the thunder of masses of guns firing along the
whole line of battle. At the time there was a thick summer haze
about, and on the ridges were the black vapours of shell bursts, and all the
air was heavy with smoke. It was out of this that the Highlanders came
marching. They brought their music with them, and the pipes of war were
playing a Scottish love-song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">I lo'e nae laddie but ane,</p>
<p class="verse">An' he lo'es nae lassie but me.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Their kilts were caked with mud, and stained with mud and filth, but the
men were splendid, marching briskly with a fine pride in their eyes. Officers
and men of other regiments watched them pass, as men who had fought
grandly, so that the dirtiest of them there and the humblest of these Jocks
was a fine gentlemen and worthy of Knighthood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>Many of them wore German helmets and grinned beneath them. One
brawny young Scot had the cap of a German staff officer cocked over his ear.
One machine-gun section brought down two German machine-guns besides
their own. They were dog-tired, but they held their heads up, and the
pipers who had been with them blew out their bags bravely, though hard-up
for wind, and the Scottish love-song rang out across the fields&mdash;whatever
its words, it was, I think, a love-song for the dear dead they had left behind
them.</p>

<p>During the battle of Arras in April of 1917 there was always a wonderful
pageant of men in that old city which had been under fire since October
in the first year of war and was badly wounded, with many of its ancient
houses utterly destroyed, but still a city with streets through which men
could march, and buildings in which they could find comfortable, but unsafe
billets. It was the headquarters of the battle which lasted in the fields outside
by Monchy Hill and by Fampoux and Roeux, Wancourt and Havinel
until the end of May. Arras is a city built above deep tunnels and vaults
made in the Middle Ages when the stone was quarried out of them to build
the houses, and lengthened and strengthened by our own engineers and
tunnellers, so that our men could live in them under the heaviest shell-fire,
and march through them to the German lines. Above, in the old squares
and streets, in houses still standing between gulfs of ruin, several of our
Divisional generals and some of our battalion commanders established
their headquarters, and when the first fierce shelling eased off&mdash;though it
never ceased until the last German retreat in the autumn of 1918&mdash;the
streets were always filled with a surging traffic of men and mules and guns
and motor lorries. Many Scottish battalions of the 15th and 51st Divisions
among others were quartered here, and on one historic day there were assembled
no less than five pipe bands in full strength, who played up and
down one of the Squares amidst crowds of fighting men of English and
Scottish regiments. I remember one such day when the pipers of the 8/10th
Gordons, commanded then by Colonel Thom, were playing in the square.
The Colonel had a proud light in his eyes as the tune, "Highland Laddie,"
swelled up to the gables and filled the open frontages of the gutted houses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Snowflakes fell lightly on the steel hats of the Scots standing in a hollow
square, and mud was splashed to the khaki aprons over their kilts as they
smiled at the fine swagger of the pipe-major and the thump of the drum-sticks;
an old woman danced a jig to the pipes, holding her skirt above
her skinny legs. She tripped up to a group of Scottish officers and spoke
quick shrill words to them. "What does the old witch say?" asked a laughing
Gordon. She had something particular to say. In 1870 she had heard
the pipes in Arras. They were played by prisoners from South Germany,
and as a young girl she had danced to them. It seemed to me a link between
two strange chapters of history in the city of Arras which had been crowded
with the ghosts of history since those days when Julius Caesar had his camp
outside its walls on the very ground&mdash;at Etrun&mdash;where our Scottish troops
had their huts.</p>

<p>The pipes of Scotland sounded in many villages of France and Flanders,
where for all time the wail of them will come down the wind to the ears
of men who hear with the spirit. They were played not only in the roads
and fields, but often at night in farmhouses where Highland officers had
their messes, or in cottages where some battalion headquarters were established
or in old houses within city walls where there was a feast or a guest
night. It was my privilege to spend some of those evenings, when down the
long table in a narrow room the pipers marched, solemnly standing behind
the guest's chair and playing old dances and marches of Bonnie Scotland.
Then the colonel would offer the pipe-major a glass of whisky, which he
would raise high, toasting the health of the officers in Gaelic. After that,
on many a good evening in a bad war, the tables would be cleared, and the
young officers would dance an eightsome reel, with laughter and simulated
passion, and shrill cries of challenge and triumph which stirred a stranger's
soul. Or the pipers themselves would be asked to give a dance, and in
stocking feet on bare boards, dance as lightly as gossamer and as nimbly
as <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Nifinsky'">Nijinsky</ins> the Russian, though big, brawny men. In small rooms the
music of the pipes was loud&mdash;too loud for any but Scottish ears&mdash;and it
was hard on a French "padre" who was trying to sleep upstairs in one
small cottage, with thin walls and cracks between old timbers of the ceiling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
while downstairs late into the night the pipers played merrily for those who
would fight in the next battle, near at hand. The effect of such pipe-music
within four walls was prodigious on a French officer whom I took one night
to the mess of the 8/10th Gordons. The full pipe-band marched in as usual,
and I saw my friend open his eyes wide and stare with amazement at this
apparition. When they stood behind his chair playing lustily, so that the
very glasses quaked on the table, he became very pale, and after the second
"strathspey" I saw him collapse in his chair in a dead swoon. The Gordons
thought this a fine tribute to their pipers. They enjoyed the incident justly
though full of consideration for the French officer. He explained to me
after the symptoms that overcame him. "I felt," he said, "enormous
waves rolling up to me and passing over me; my heart beat wildly, and
vivid colours rushed past my eyes. Then I knew no more!" Nothing
would induce him to suffer such musical agony again.</p>

<p>I shall always remember one piper I saw in the ruins of the Château of
Caulaincourt. How he came there, or why he stayed there, I do not know,
because few of our troops were in the neighbourhood, and the place was
a desert. The château had been a vast place, with high walls and terraces
and out-houses, but the whole place had been hurled into ruin by the Germans
on their first retreat in the spring of 1917. They had opened the
family vaults and pillaged the coffins, and I remember being struck by the
pathos of a little marble tablet I saw on a refuse heap, to which it had been
flung. On it were the words in French, "The heart of Madame la Marquise
de Caulaincourt." Poor dead heart of Madame la Marquise! In life it
would have broken at the sight of all this ruin. But there, quite alone, on
the central avalanche of stones, stood a Scottish piper playing a lament....
I heard from other officers that he was seen there later, still alone,
and still playing his pipes, but why we could not tell.</p>

<p>The last time I heard the pipes was at the end of the war. They were
playing Scottish troops over a bridge across the Rhine, at Cologne, and at
the journeys' end of all that long and tragic way through which our men
had fought with heroism, through frightful fire, with dreadful losses, until
victory was theirs, final and complete. Along those roads the pipes of war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
went playing, month after month, year after year, from one battle to another,
and in their music for ever, as long as remembrance of this war lasts,
there will be the tears and the tragedy and the triumph, reminding the world
of all that gallant youth of Scotland which fought in France.</p>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">Arthur Fetterless</span></p>

<p class="noindent">I do not think any one can write with greater pleasure than I for the Pipers'
Record. My only regret is that, personally, I never chanced to see the
pipes go into direct action. I know that, in the earlier stages of the war,
and in a few celebrated cases later, the pipes went into the charge,
but I had not the good fortune to be present on one of these occasions.
Others, however, will have written of these things, and I do not think I
can do better than speak of events actually known to myself relating to the
pipes and the pipers in the general life of the war.</p>

<p>The pipes! Ah! No memories of the great war will ever be complete
to any member of a Highland regiment without the recollection of the pipes,
for they are unquestionably the finest battle instrument ever created.
They mourned with us in hours of sorrow. They cheered us in hours of
weariness. They played gaily in hours of rest and merriment.</p>

<p>Back in billets, in ruined villages, half the battalion would turn out to
hear "Retreat" played by the pipe-band. It was one of the events of the
day, in the summer in the sweltering heat of the dust-laden huts behind
the front-line, in the winter in the dank cold mid the seas of mud, in the
midst of which the pipers played upon an island that was sometimes almost
a floating raft.</p>

<p>At these times the rumble of the guns was overwhelmed, and the horrors
of war and the atmosphere were for a little time forgotten. And the fact
that the pipes were the pride of the battalion was evident from the remarks
of the men, if several Highland battalions were billeted together.</p>

<p>"Your pipes are no' a patch on ours!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aw, away wi' ye, look at yer big drum; he canna twirl his sticks
above his heid."</p>

<p>"Umph! We've got a pipe-major, onyhoo."</p>

<p>"Aye." A grudging admission.</p>

<p>Such remarks were of the everyday talk of the men who heard the pipes.</p>

<p>Again, at the periodical meetings and games of Highland brigades, the
massed bands of the battalions were always there playing a mighty skirl.
There were, of course, piping competitions in conjunction with competitions
in Highland dancing and sport.</p>

<p>All these occasions did much to rob modern war of its dismal character,
and bring back something of the glamour of arms, and the glory of strong
men.</p>

<p>But enough of general remarks. I wish to write of five typical scenes
from the life of the war relating to pipes and the pipers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the first I am standing at the entrance to one of the low dug-outs,
covered over with turf, which used to lie, and perhaps still exist, a few
hundred yards from the Café Belge up the road to Ypres. Most people who
fought in that sector found a billet in them at some time, or knew them&mdash;filthy
they were.</p>

<p>Overhead a couple of aeroplanes are hovering, very high up. An occasional
shell can be heard, coming from a long distance away, with a rolling
noise. The shells are probably 9-inch or perhaps larger, and they are bursting
with crash and splash in the fields around or near the road.</p>

<p>From the direction of the Café Belge I see a company of men in kilts
advancing, men heavily laden with all the usual impedimenta of packs,
rifles, etc. They look, in the distance, tired and grim, and in formation they
are straggling, owing to the appallingly muddy state of the road.</p>

<p>A shell bursts in the field to the left of the road along which they are
coming. There is a heavy cloud of smoke, and streams of mud and slime
are spued upwards and around. For a moment the leader seems to hesitate,
and the party halts. Then they move on again.</p>

<p>Suddenly there is a sound as of tuning up, and two pipers commence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
to play. The advancing men steady in formation and come slogging through
the mud, with step almost rhythmic to the music.</p>

<p>"Crash!" Another shell bursts nearer them, splashing some of the
platoon with mud. The pipes play on.</p>

<p>"Crash!" A third shell bursts short of them.</p>

<p>The pipes play on, and the men march steadily past to the music of the
pipes. They cover another hundred yards, and a shell bursts in the road
where the platoon were marching a few seconds before. I say to myself,
"Thank God, they got through in time."</p>

<p>As I look back it seems to me that that was not too bad an example
of steadiness of pipers and men under dangerous fire. But of course it was
all just an everyday sort of thing&mdash;a few men relieving trenches with a
couple of pipers to cheer them on the way up&mdash;part of the everyday life of
war.</p>

<p>The pipes only began to play after the shelling broke out.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My second scene is an incident taken from life in France. I think the
pipes did their share in fostering the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entente</i>, and the arrival of Highland
battalions with their pipe-bands marching in front did much to engrave
in the hearts of the French people memories which will be carried on from
generation to generation.</p>

<p>In this second scene I stood at the entrance to a French town when a
very famous battalion entered the main street marching to attention, with
pipe-band playing. It was the first Scottish battalion to enter that town.</p>

<p>Near me stood a little girl in a white dress. Her face, on seeing the
band, first expressed astonishment. The expression changed to pleased
interest, and finally she burst into gleeful smiles.</p>

<p>As the band came near her she danced along beside the pipers, a
beautiful golden-haired child, supremely happy.</p>

<p>The people standing around cheered and waved with French enthusiasm.
To them undoubtedly, in one of the darkest hours of the war&mdash;those magnificent
men and the music of the pipes bore a message of hope and determination,
with the promise of ultimate victory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>To any people who are inclined to be supercilious about pipe-music,
the recollection of the unfeigned pleasure of a beautiful child on hearing
the pipes for the first time has often seemed to me to supply an answer.
Those who cannot understand pipe-music might be able to do so if they
were ready to receive it in the same simple spirit.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>About the end of October 1915 the trenches on Hill 60 in front of Ypres,
were in a particularly sodden state. The rotting sandbags which formed
the parapets were a mass of oozing earth, continually being scattered by
shell-fire and rebuilt again by the toilsome labours of mud-covered "Jocks."</p>

<p>The Hun sniper, too, was exceptionally vigilant in these parts, and, as
he had the advantage of ground and of enfilade fire from several points,
to put a head above the parapet in daylight meant almost certain death.
Men also were being continually wounded and killed while passing along
the trenches at points where the parapet had become too low, and it had not
been possible to build it up quickly enough.</p>

<p>As the combined result of shell-fire, sniping, and the bad state of the
trenches, the amount of work which could be done in daylight was small.
Repairs were done at night. There were also, on account of these difficulties
and others, very few loop-holes available, so that, excepting through periscopes,
the average man saw very little of the enemy. He scarcely ever
got a shot at him by day. I suppose it was the result of all these things
put together which created the scene.</p>

<p>On a very dull morning a party of Seaforths were gathered in a bay of
one of the trenches. I was round the traverse in the next bay. One of
the party of men was on sentry duty with a periscope; the rest were cleaning
rifles.</p>

<p>Owing to the dullness of the day, mud and filth, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ensemble</i> was dismal.
Suddenly there sounded from the direction of Sanctuary Wood the music of
pipes playing. Why they were playing then, or where exactly they were
playing, I have never known, but there certainly floated across to the
dismal trenches the music of "Horo, My Nut Brown Maiden."</p>

<p>To us in the trenches the distant music sounded perfectly glorious, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
the burdens of the hour were for a time lifted away. That the men found it
so was evident from their action.</p>

<p>Everybody knows the soldier's version which runs to the same air,
and it apparently struck the fancy of the men as applicable to the occasion,
for there burst forth from the adjoining bay a cheerful chorus:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Aa canna see the tairget,</p>
<p class="verse">Aa canna see the tairget,</p>
<p class="verse">Oh, aa canna see the tairget,</p>
<p class="verse4">It's owre far awa."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The last line was converted by one of the chorus party into the line:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"For Jerry he's owre fly."</p>
</div></div>

<p>On looking round the corner of the traverse I saw the concert-party
incredibly cheerful, and entirely oblivious of war, mud or danger, for the
pipes had asserted their sway.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are many marches which the pipers made, including marches to
battle, of which I might write, but I think my second last reminiscence
had best be taken from the journey of the conquering Second Army which
tramped from Ypres to the Rhine on the last great triumphal march.</p>

<p>Of the 250 miles odd which the Army covered, I am certain that the
pipers of my battalion piped at least a good half, perhaps more.</p>

<p>What could we have done without them on that march? As we tramped
through village after village and town after town, neath welcome banners
and cheering crowds, men wearied with marching, not always too amply
rationed, yet swung forward with assured tread to the lilt of the pipes through
every village and town.</p>

<p>Welcoming bands played the Marseillaise, the Brabançonne, and the
British Anthem, and the crowds shouted their "Vive les Alliês," etc. The
pipes played their regimental and national marches in return, and if intercommunication
through language was not perfect, yet there was complete
accord through music.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>Undoubtedly, on that never-to-be-forgotten march, the pipes were indispensable.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The last scene is taken from Germany. Perhaps I should speak of
massed bands parading in the main squares and streets of the great towns
of the Rhine, bringing home to the Hun as forcibly as in any way the destruction
of his ill-judged schemes; or perhaps I should speak of the pipers on
some of the great occasions&mdash;presentations of medals, presentations of
colours, etc.</p>

<p>I prefer to write of a very simple event. Happening where it did, it
seemed so homely.</p>

<p>I was riding through a forest not far from Cologne when I heard the
music of pipes. I turned off the road and proceeded along a pathway which
led to a green sward in the forest.</p>

<p>There I saw a solitary piper marching slowly up and down playing a
lament. His loneliness seemed to me to symbolise two things&mdash;the completeness
of victory, and the detachment of the conquerors. The music
sounded very beautiful among the trees.</p>

<p>I did not interrupt the piper, but if I know anything at all of piping,
I am sure that that piper in the forest felt for a little while almost as if he
were treading his native heath again, and dreamt of the Highland hills and
forests from which he had come.</p>

<p>After all, in Germany, we were strangers in a strange land and not wishing
to stay there. Having done our work, we said in our hearts, "let us away!"
for the Huns will always be Hunnish. But we are Highland, and the pipes
are calling us home.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Beat on drums; let the pipes play and the banners be unfurled for every
triumphal march that shall be. But when the marches are played let us
never forget that every march has grown more glorious by the war and the
blood of the men who fell; that every march has woven around it a thousand
memories of life and death, of hardship, of danger, and of victory.</p>

<p>In days to come we will remember&mdash;to battle we went by <em>that</em> march;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
to Longueval we went by <em>that</em> march; and from Loos we came by <em>that</em> one.
And for every battle march that the pipers play, we know that a million
feet and more have marched to its song.</p>

<p>That record of great work&mdash;that, with death and other things they did
not count&mdash;<em>that</em> is the Pipers' Record.</p>

<p class="noindent">Col Maclean, on two sticks, and with tartan trousers on, came down
between the whins to the poles where the nets were drying, and joined the
Trosdale folk in the nets' shade. 'Twas the Saturday afternoon; they were
frankly idling, the township people&mdash;except that the women knitted, which
is a way of being indolent in the Islands&mdash;and had been listening for an
hour to an heroic tale of the old sea-robber days from Patrick Macneill,
the most gifted liar in the parish. A little fire of green wood burned to keep
the midges off, and it was hissing like a gander.</p>

<p>"Take your share of the smoke and let down your weariness, darling,"
said one of the elder women, pushing towards the piper a herring firken.
Nobody looked at his sticks nor his dragging limb&mdash;not even the children;
had he not been a Gael himself Maclean might have fancied his lameness
was unperceived. He bitterly knew better, but pushed his sticks behind
the nets as he seated himself, and seated, with his crutches absent, he was
a fellow to charm the eye of maid or sergeant-major.</p>

<p>"Your pipes might be a widow, she's so seldom seen or heard since you
came home," said one of the fishermen.</p>

<p>"And that's the true word," answered Col Maclean. "A widow indeed,
without her man! Never in all my life played I <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">piob mhor</i> but on my feet
and they jaunty! I'll never put a breath again in sheep-skin. If they had
only blinded me!"</p>

<p>There was in the company, Margaret, daughter of the bailie; she had
been a toddling white-haired child when Col went to France, and had to
be lifted to his knees; now she got up on them herself at a jump,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
and put her arms round his neck, tickling him with her fingers till he
laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh bold one! Let Col be!" her mother commanded; "thou wilt
spoil his beautiful tartan trews."</p>

<p>"It is Col must tell a story now," said the little one, thinking of the
many he used to tell her before he became a soldier.</p>

<p>"It is not the time for wee folks stories," said the mother; "but maybe
he will tell us something not too bloody for Sunday's eve about the Wars."</p>

<p>Col Maclean, for the first time, there and then, gave his tale of The
Oldest Air in the World.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"I was thinking to myself," said he, "as I was coming through the
whins there, that even now, in creeks of the sea like this, beside their nets
adrying, there must be crofter folk in France, and they at <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">ceilidh</i> like yourselves,
telling of tales and putting to each other riddles."</p>

<p>"<em>Ubh! ubh!</em> It is certain there are no crofters in France, whatever,"
said William-the-Elder. "It is wine they drink in France, as I heard tell
from the time I was the height of a Lorne shoe, and who ever heard of
crofters drinking wine?"</p>

<p>"Wherever are country people and the sea beside them to snatch a
meal from, you will find the croft," insisted Col the piper. "They have the
croft in France, though they have a different name for it from ours, and
I'll wager the bulk of the land they labour is as bare as a bore's snout, for
that is what sheep and deer have left in Europe for the small spade-farmer."</p>

<p>"Did'st see the crofting lands out yonder?" asked Margaret's mother.</p>

<p>"No," said the piper; "but plenty I saw of the men they breed there;
I ate with them, and marched with them, and battled at their side, for we
were not always playing the pipes, we music-fellows.</p>

<p>"And that puts me in mind of a thing&mdash;there is a people yonder, over
in France, that play the bagpipe&mdash;they call them Brettanach&mdash;the Bretons.
They are the same folk as ourselves though kind of Frenchmen too, wine-drinking,
dark and Papist. Race, as the old-word says, goes down to the
rock, and you could tell at the first glance of a Brettanach that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
kin to us though a kilt was never on his loins, and not one word in his head
of the Gaelic language. 'Tis history! Someway&mdash;some time&mdash;far back&mdash;they
were sundered from us, the Brettanach, and now have their habitation
far enough from Albyn of the mountains, glens and heroes. Followers of
the sea, fishermen or farmers; God-fearing, good hard drinkers, in their
fashion&mdash;many a time I looked at one and said to myself, 'There goes a
man of Skye or Lewis!'"</p>

<p>"And the girls of them?" said Ranald Gorm, with a twinkle of the eyes.</p>

<p>"You have me there!" said Col. "I never saw woman-kind of the
Brettanach; the war never went into their country, and the Bretons I
saw were in regiments of the army, far enough from home like myself, in
the champagne shires where they make the wine.</p>

<p>"We came on them first in a town called Corbie, with a church so grand
and spacious a priest might bellow his head off and never be heard by the
poor in the seats behind. 'Twas on a week-day, a Mass was making; that
was the first and last time ever I played pipes in the House of God,
and faith! that not by my own desiring. 'Twas some fancy of the priests,
connived between them and the Cornal. Fifteen of us marched the flag-stones
of yon kirk of Corbie playing 'Fingal's Weeping.'"</p>

<p>"A good brave tune!" remarked the bailie.</p>

<p>"A brave tune, and a bonny! I'll warrant yon one made the rafters
shiver! The kirk was filled with a corps of the tribe I mention&mdash;the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Bretannach'">Brettanach</ins>&mdash;and
they at their Papist worshipping; like ourselves, just country
folk that would sooner be at the fishing or the croft than making warfare.</p>

<p>"My eye fell, in particular, on a fellow that was a sergeant, most desperate
like my uncle Sandy&mdash;so like I could have cried across the kirk to
him 'Oh uncle! what do ye do so far from Salen?' The French, for ordinary,
are black as sloes, but he was red, red, a noble head on him like
a bullock, an eagle nose, and a beard cut square and gallant.</p>

<p>"When the kirk spilled out its folk, they hung awhile about the burial-yard
as we do ourselves in Trosdale, spelling the names on the head-stones,
gossiping, and by-and-bye slipped out, I doubt not, to a change-house for
a dram, and all the pipers with them except myself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>"God bless me!" cried Ronald Gorm.</p>

<p>"Believe it or not, but I hung back and sought my friend the red one.
He was sitting all his lone on a slab in the strangers' portion of the graveyard,
under yews, eating bread and onion and sipping wine from his flask
of war. Now the droll thing is that though I knew he had not one word
of Christian Gaelic in his cheek, 'twas the Gaelic I must speak to
him.</p>

<p>"'Just man,' says I to him. 'Health to you and a hunter's hunger!
I was looking at you yonder in the kirk, and a gentleman more like my
clansman Sandy Ruadh of Salen is surely not within the four brown borders
of the world nor on the deeps of ocean. Your father must have come from
the Western Isles, or the mother of you been wandering.'</p>

<p>"Of all I said to him he knew but the one word that means the same
thing, as they tell me, in all Celtdom&mdash;<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">eaglais</i>. To his feet got the Frenchman,
stretched out to me his bread and wine, with a half-laugh on him
most desperate like Uncle Sandy, and said <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">eaglais</i> too, with a flourish of the
heel of his loaf at the kirk behind him to show he understood that, anyway.
We sat on the slab, the pair of us, my pipes stretched out between us, and
there I assure, folk, was the hour of conversation!"</p>

<p>"But if you could not speak each other's tongue?" said a girl.</p>

<p>"<em>Tach!</em> two men of the breed with a set of pipes between them can
always follow one another. 'Tis my belief if I stood his words on end and
could follow them backwards they would be good Gaelic of Erin. The better
half of our speech was with our hands; he had not even got the English;
and most of the time we talked pipe-music, as any man can do that's fit
to pucker his lips and whistle. The Breton people <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">canntarach</i> tunes too,
like ourselves&mdash;soft-warbling them to fix them in the memory, and blyth
that morning was our warbling; he could charm, my man, the very thrush
from trees! But Herself&mdash;the <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">piob mhor</i>&mdash;was an instrument beyond his
fingering; the pipes he used at home he called <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">biornieu</i>, fashioned differently
from ours. Yet the same wind blows through reeds in France or Scotland,
and everywhere they sing of old and simple things; you are deaf indeed if
you cannot understand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>"He was from the seashore&mdash;John his name&mdash;a mariner to his trade&mdash;with
a wife and seven children; himself the son of a cooper.</p>

<p>"I am a good hand at the talking myself, as little Margaret here will
tell you, but his talk was like a stream in spate, and the arms of him went
flourishing like drum-sticks. Keep mind of this&mdash;that the two of us, by now,
were all alone in the kirk-yard, on a little hillock with the great big cliff
of a kirk above us, and the town below all humming with the soldiers, like
a byke of bees.</p>

<p>"He bade me play on the pipes at last and I put them in my oxter
and gave him 'Lochiel's awa' to France.' A fine tune! but someway I
felt I never reached him. I tried him then with bits of 'The Bugle
Horn,' 'Take your gun to the Hill,' 'Bonnie Ann' and 'The Persevering
Lover;' he beat time with a foot to them, and clapped
my shoulder, but for all that they said to him I might as well be playing
on a fiddle.</p>

<p>"It was only when I tried an old <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">port-mor</i>&mdash;"The Spoil of the Lowlands
now graze in the Glen" that his whiskers bristled, and at that said I to myself
'I have you Uncle Sandy!'</p>

<p>"Before the light that flickered was gone from him I blew it up to a
height again with 'Come to me Kinsman!'</p>

<p>"He was like a fellow that would be under spells!</p>

<p>"'The Good Being be about me!' cried he, and his eyes like flambeaux,
'what tune is that?'</p>

<p>"You never, never, never saw a man so much uplifted!</p>

<p>"'They call it,' said I, 'Come to me Kinsman,' (<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Thigibh a so a charaid!</i>),
and it has the name, in the small Isles of the West, of the Oldest Air of the
World. The very ravens know it; what is it but the cry of men in trouble?
It's older than the cairns of Icolmkill, and cried the clans from out of the
Isles to Harlaw. Listen you well!' and I played it to him again&mdash;not all
the MacCrimmons that ever came from Skye could play it better! For
grand was the day and white with sun, and to-morrow we were marching.
And many a lad of ours was dead behind us.</p>

<p>"When I was done, he did a droll thing then, the red fellow&mdash;put his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
arms about my shoulders and kissed me on the face! And the beard of
him like a flaming whin!</p>

<p>"What must he do but learn it? Over and over again I had to whistle
it to him till he had it to the very finish, and all the time the guns were going
in the east.</p>

<p>"'If ever you were in trouble,' I said to him&mdash;though of course he
could not understand me, 'and you whistled but one blast of that air, it
is Col Maclean would be at your side though the world were staving in below
your feet like one of your father's barrels!'"</p>


<p class="p1 center">II</p>

<p>The day was done in Trosdale. Beyond the rim of the sea the sun had
slid to make a Sabbath morning further round the world, and all the sky
in the west was streaming fire. Over the flats of Heisker the light began
to wink on the Monach islets. Ebbed tide left bare sand round Kirkibost,
and the sea-birds settled on them, rising at times in flocks and eddying in
the air as if they were leaves and a wind had blow them. Curlews were
piping bitterly.</p>

<p>Behind the creek where the folk were gathered on the sea-pinks, talking,
Trosdale clachan sent up the reek of evening fires, and the bairns were being
cried in from the fields.</p>

<p>The Catechist, sombre fellow, already into his Sabbath, though 'twas
only Saturday nine o' the clock, came through the whins and cast about
him a glance for bagpipes. He had seen Maclean's arrival with misgiving.
A worthy man, and a face on him like the underside of a two-year skate-fish.</p>

<p>Col Maclean turned on him a visage tanned as if it had been in the
cauldron with the catechu of the barking nets.</p>

<p>"Take you a firken too, and rest you, Catechist," said he. "You see
I have not my pipes to-night, but I'm at <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">sgeulachd</i>."</p>

<p>But the Catechist sat not; and leaning against a net-pole sighed.</p>

<p>"'Twas two years after that," said Col, again into the rapture of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
story, "when my regiment went to the land of wine, where we battled beside
the French. I assure you we did nobly! nobly! Nor, on the soul of me!
were the Frenchmen slack!"</p>

<p>"The French," ventured Patrick Macneill, "are renowned in story for
all manly parts. Oh King! 'tis they have suffered!"</p>

<p>"'Tis myself, just man, that is not denying it! We were yonder in
a land like Keppoch desolate after the red cock's crowing. The stars themselves,
that are acquaint with grief, and have seen great tribulation in the
dark of Time would sicken at the sight of it! Nothing left of the towns
but <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">larochs</i>&mdash;heaps of lime and rubble where the rat made habitation, and
not one chimney reeking in a hundred miles. Little we ken of trees here in
the Islands, but they were yonder planted thick as bracken and cut down
to the stump the way you would be cutting winter kail. And the fields
that the country folk had laboured!&mdash;were the Minch drained dry, the
floor of it would seem no likelier place for cropping barley or for pasturing
goats.</p>

<p>"There was a day of days, out yonder, that we mixed up with the
French and cleared the breadth of a parish of <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">am boche</i>, who was ill to shift.
But the mouth of the night brought him back on us most desperate altogether,
and half we had gained by noon was lost by gloaming.</p>

<p>"Five score and ten of our men were missing at the roll-call.</p>

<p>"The Cornal grunted. 'Every man of them out of Lewis!' says he;
'they're either dead or wandered. Go you out Col Maclean with your
beautiful, lovely, splendid pipes, and gather at least the living.'</p>

<p>"Not one morsel of meat had I eaten for twenty hours, and the inside
of me just one hole full of hunger, but out went Col and his pipes to herding!</p>

<p>"Oh King of the Elements! but that was the night most foul, with
the kingdom of France a rag for wetness, and mire to the hose-tops. Rain
lashed; a scourging wind whipped over the country, and it was stinking
like a brock from tatters that had been men. The German guns were pelting
it, the sound of them a bellow no more broken than the roar on skerries
at Martinmas, the flash of them in the sky like Merry Dancers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>"I got in a while to the length of a steading with a gable standing;
tuned up <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">piob mhor</i> and played the gathering. They heard me, the lads&mdash;the
living of them; two-over-twenty of them came up to me by the gable,
with no more kenning of what airt they were in than if a fog had found
them midway on the Long Ford of Uist. I led them back to King George's
furrows where our folk were, and then, <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">mo chreach!</i> when we counted them,
one was missing!</p>

<p>"'It is not a good herd you are, Maclean,' said the Cornal, 'you will
just go back and find Duncan Ban; he's the only man in the regiment I
can trust to clean my boots.'</p>

<p>"So back went Col in search of Duncan."</p>

<p>"Oh lad! weren't you the gallant fellow!" cried Margaret's mother,
adoring.</p>

<p>"I was that, I assure you! If it were not the pipes were in my arm-pit
like a girl, my feet would not keep up on me the way I would be pelting
any other road than the way I had to go. But my grief! I never got my
man, nor no man after ever found him. I went to the very ditches where
<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">am boche</i> was lying, and 't was there that a light went up that made the
country round about as white-bright as the day, and I in the midst of it
with my pipes in hand. They threw at me grey lead as if it had been gravel,
and I fell."</p>

<p>"<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Och, a mheudail bhochd!</i>&mdash;Oh treasure!" said the women of Trosdale
all together.</p>

<p>"I got to my knees in a bit and crawled, as it might be for a lifetime,
one ache from head to heel, till I came to a hole as deep's a quarry where had
been the crossing of roads, and there my soul went out of me. When I
came to myself I was playing pipes and the day was on the land. The
Good Being knows what I played, but who should come out across the
plain to me but a Frenchman!</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"He moved as spindrift from spindrift,</p>
<p class="verse">As a furious winter wind&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse">So swiftly, sprucely, cheerily,</p>
<p class="verse">Oh! proudly,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
<p class="verse">Through glens and high-tops,</p>
<p class="verse">And no stop made he</p>
<p class="verse">Until he came</p>
<p class="verse">To the city and court of Maclean,</p>
<p class="verse">Maclean of the torments,</p>
<p class="verse">Playing his pipes."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The Catechist writhed; the people of Trosdale shivered; Patrick
Macneill wept softly, for Col Maclean, the cunning one, by the rhyming
trick of the ancient sennachies, had flung them, unexpected, into the giddiness
of his own swound, and all of them, wounded, dazed, saw the Frenchman
come like a shadow into the world of shades.</p>

<p>"He flung himself in the hole beside me, did the Frenchman, gave me
a sup of spirits and put soft linen to my sores, and all the time grey lead
was snarling over us.</p>

<p>"'Make use of thy good hale feet, lad,' said I to him, 'and get out of
this dirty weather! Heed not the remnants of Col Maclean. What fetched
thee hither?'</p>

<p>"He put his hand on my pipes and whistled a stave of the old tune.</p>

<p>"'How learned ye that?' I asked him.</p>

<p>"Although he was Brettanach he had a little of the English. 'Red
John our sergeant, peace be with him! heard you playing it all last night,'
said he, 'took a craze at the tune of you and went out to find you, but never
came back. Then another man, peace be with him! a cousin of John,
heard your playing and went seeking you, but he came back not either.
I heard you first, myself, no more than an hour ago, and had no sooner
got your tune into my head than it quickened me like drink, and here am
I, kinsman!'</p>

<p>"'Good lad!' I cried, 'all the waters in the world will not wash out
kinship, nor the Gael be forsaken while there is love and song.'"</p>

<p>"Vain tales! Vain tales!" groaned the Catechist, and his face like a
skate.</p>

<h2><a name="FLESH_TO_THE_EAGLES" id="FLESH_TO_THE_EAGLES"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">FLESH TO THE EAGLES</a></h2>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">Boyd Cable</span></p>

<p class="noindent">It was during the retreat of 1914 that a Highland regiment was quartered
for a night in one of the French villages, and billetted in houses, barns,
anywhere the hospitable villagers could give them room. The officers established
their Mess and quarters in "The Chateau," a big house on the outskirts
of the village. Many of the villagers had already cleared out, but
in the Chateau the officers found the mistress of the house, her daughter,
and her servants, standing staunchly to their place; the master of the
house being, as they were told, in the French Army.</p>

<p>Madame spoke English fairly well, the daughter very well&mdash;when she
did speak, which was seldom. She was a young and pretty girl of perhaps
fifteen to sixteen years of age, fresh come from a convent school, reserved,
timid and shy, in the presence of the officers almost to a point of shrinking
when they spoke to her. Yet, although they could see her shiver and blanch
at the sound of the distant grumble of the guns, she supported her mother
bravely and asserted stoutly that she was not afraid to stay, when the C.O.
and some of the other officers questioned the wisdom of the household
waiting for the Germans to advance.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, monsieur," said Madame, "your soldiers will possible arrest
the advance before the Allemands arrive at us here. And if it is not so, it is,
after all, soldiers of the Allemands that will come, and they will not harm
women and old men and boys who make no provocation or resistance."</p>

<p>Unfortunately the practices of German soldiers were not then sufficiently
known to the officers to make them press their argument beyond reasonable
limits, and they gave in reluctantly to Madame's reasoning. "We cannot the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
children and the very old to march away," she said, "and one could not go
and leave them here. Me, I stay to speak with the enemy officers and see
my people do nothing foolish. I cannot run away and leave them."</p>

<p>So they left it at that.</p>

<p>Madame gave them dinner that night in the dining-room, and it was
after dinner that one of the regimental pipers was heard parading round and
playing tune after tune. Madame and Mademoiselle were greatly interested
and asked many questions.</p>

<p>"But there," cried Madame at one tune, "there is the music most
fierce. It sound&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is battle music, Madame," explained the C.O. "Music of a war
song of the Highlands&mdash;of the Écossais. Ask Monsieur l'Adjutant for the
words of the song."</p>

<p>So the Adjutant recited "The Macgregors' Gathering," with all the
fire and ardour of a fiery Scot, and a Macgregor at that. Madame sat with
brows knit, plainly struggling to follow the English words; her daughter,
as plainly understanding them clearly, held her breath and listened spellbound
and wondering to the words. Her head lifted and her eye lit to some
of the lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse"><em>While there's leaves in the forest and foam on the river,</em></p>
<p class="verse"><em>Macgregor, despite them, shall flourish for ever.</em></p>
</div></div>

<p>But at others, delivered with fierce emphasis and dramatic fervour, she
shrank back with quivering lip and pain on her face:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse"><em>If they rob us of name and pursue us with beagles,</em></p>
<p class="verse"><em>Give their roofs to the flames, their flesh to the eagles.</em></p>
</div></div>

<p>When the Adjutant had finished and had sat down, looking a little
shame-faced at having allowed his feelings to so carry him away, Madame
and the girl spoke rapidly in French for a minute.</p>

<p>Then Madame shook her head. "But no," she said, "I do not like it,
this song. It is cru-el, cru-el. How says it&mdash;'The roof to the burning,
and the bodies, the dead, the flesh, to the birds of prey.' But no, that is
the war of savage."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>The C.O. tried to explain to her, while the Adjutant did so even more
eagerly to the girl, that it was war of the most savage and relentless kind
that ran in those far back days in the Highlands of Scotland; but again
Madame protested. "It is too cru-el. I do not like it that you make such
song and such music now. War, it is no more so. What is it your song
says of the burning of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la maison</i>?" She made the Adjutant repeat the
lines and repeated after him, "Ah, m'sieu, 'Give their roof to the flames,
their flesh to the eagles.' That is, burn the shelter of the women and children,
and leave the dead unbury. You would not do that; even the Boche
that we despise would not do this thing. It is cru-el, cru-el."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle said nothing, but they could all see the shrinking in her
eyes as she looked at them, the wonder if, even now, the Écossais could
be so savage as to make such war. The Adjutant set himself to remove
such an idea of their barbarity from her mind, and with some success apparently,
since there was little shrinking and no more than a faint blush of
timid friendship when they said good-night and retired.</p>

<p>Next morning the orders came, sharp, urgent and imperative, to move
at once, and there was little time for farewells. But Madame and the girl
were both out to see them off and watch the battalion tramp by. The pipes
at their head were screaming their vengeful music, "Give their roof to the
flames, their flesh to the eagles," until the Adjutant, seeing the protesting
motion of Madame's hands to her ears, hurried to the pipers and asked them
to change the tune.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After the ebb of our retreat and the period of the Marne, came the
full flood-tide of our advance, and the sweeping forward of the French and
British over the ground the Germans had taken and held a space. As the
luck had it, the same Highland battalion came back through the same village
where they had billetted that night&mdash;or rather to the shell, the wreckage,
the remains of the same village. The men by now were coming to know
what sort of treatment had been served out to the conquered country by
the Germans, and were angry enough at some of the sights they had seen,
the tales they had heard. But the anger had been cold and impersonal until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
now, when they came swinging in to this friendly spot, through the shattered
houses and streets littered with broken bottles and household goods, saw
the gaping windows to the houses, the smoke-blackened shells here and
there, the signs of pillage and wanton destruction everywhere. The cavalry
and an advance guard regiment had been through before them, but it was
plain that no fighting had taken place here, that no shell-fire had wrought
this damage, that cold-blooded "frightfulness" alone had to answer for it.
They were roused to fresh wrath by what they saw, but to a still greater
pitch of fury by the tales they heard from the quaking villagers who were
left, or who came creeping in from the fields and ditches to which they had
fled on word of approaching soldiers. The sights were no more than the
men had been seeing in any of a dozen villages passed, the tales no more than
they had heard a score of times in the past few days; but in this village
they had been made welcome, had been treated to the best, had made quick
but happy friendships; and they felt a personal injury and pity for the
brutally treated villagers.</p>

<p>The battalion halted there for an hour or so and ate their midday meal&mdash;or
rather gave it to the hungry women and children and watched them eat&mdash;and
heard fresh and more horrible tales and half-tales that were too bestial
to be told in full.</p>

<p>The moment the battalion had fallen out and he was free, the Adjutant
had asked the Colonel if he might go to the Chateau and make enquiries....</p>

<p>But when he and another officer came there they found none to make
enquiries of. The house still stood, intact so far as the building itself went,
but otherwise no more than a litter of rubbish and wreckage. Every stick
of furniture that would break was broken, every crock and dish and bottle
was scattered in splinters over the floors, every curtain, blanket and sheet,
every item of bed and table linen, every piece of clothing was torn, dirtied,
and defiled as completely as men and beasts could do it; every shelf and
door and balustrade and fitting was hacked and broken and wrenched
out of place; every room on the ground floor had been used as horses'
stables and left as foul as a stable could be; every upper room was so
befouled that, by comparison, the places of the animals below was the cleaner.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>The two officers hunted through the house, outside and round the out-buildings,
and found no one; and, nauseated by what they had seen and
heart-sick at thought of the women who had been there, returned to the
village. As they entered it again they heard pipe music softly played,
and seeing down a bye-street a cluster of their men, and hearing the sound
of a woman's voice raised loud above the pipe music, they turned off and
pushed in to see what was afoot.</p>

<p>They found a woman in the centre of a close-pressing ring of their men,
a woman wild-eyed, with grey hair in disorder, with black and blue bruises
on her face, with her clothing torn and grimed with dirt.</p>

<p>"Good God!" exclaimed the Adjutant. "Madame!"</p>

<p>He thrust a way through the men to her, but when he spoke to her and
asked her to come with him, she clutched and held his wrist, and stood there
and made him&mdash;short of using force to her&mdash;stand and listen with the men.
A dozen times he tried to interrupt, but she would not be interrupted, so
at last he left her to go on with her tale and asked the other officer to go
and bring the C.O.</p>

<p>But before the C.O. came, he, like the men, was under the spell of the
woman and of her tale, was listening, like them, with his heart turning
cold and a deadly bitter anger rising in his heart. She spoke to them in
English, breaking off at times into voluble torrents of French, checking
herself and going back and repeating as best she could in English again.
But although French words and phrases and sentences were mixed through
her English, the tale was horribly plain and clear, the stories detailed and
circumstantial enough to make it evident they were desperately true.</p>

<p>She told of women, girls, girl-children, outraged, and afterwards, in some
cases, mutilated and bayoneted; she told of old men and <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'boys haled'">boys hauled</ins> out
and stood against a wall and shot while their women were made to stand
and look on; of one woman who refused to make coffee for the Germans
until they dipped the head of her infant in a pan of boiling water; of another
woman who was crucified, pinned to the door with bayonets while the arm
of her child was broken and its body was flung down on the ground before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>her and left there writhing ... all this and more she told, and helped
her story out with rapid gesticulations and imitative motions and sounds
of the child squirming and whining and the helpless mother wrenching at
the pinning bayonets, while the men pressed in, glowering and cursing
under breath, and behind them the pipe music skirled and wailed "roofs
to the flames, and their flesh to the eagles."</p>

<p>And then, lastly, she told them of herself and her daughter, the girl of
fifteen, fresh from a convent school, timid as a child and shrinking from
the look, much less the touch of a man ... and of what they had done
to her, while they held her daughter and made her watch; and then had
done to the daughter, while she in turn was held to see and not allowed to
look away or even close her ears to the cries. She told it all, sparing herself
and her child no word and no item of their shame; and then&mdash;this was
just before the Colonel arrived&mdash;she paused and looked round at the ring
of savage faces about her, and lifted her two hands and shook them above
her head.</p>

<p>"I am French, and you are Anglais," she cried, "but I am woman and
you are men. I have told you, so that you may know the animals you fight.
I have asked your music-man will he play this song you have, that with
the music I say it to you 'Give their roofs to the flames, their flesh to the
eagles.' And if ever you have Germans soldat at your mercy, and they
cry for pity, remember this village, and its women and my daughter, and
me. Give us revanche ... their flesh to the eagles...."</p>

<p>The Colonel broke in here, and, finding she was not to be stopped, turned
and ordered the men away, and when they had gone, handed Madame over
to some of the village women who watched timidly from their doors. Madame
had told nothing but truth they assured him. Mademoiselle? Ah, ma'm'zelle
could not be seen; she hid in a cellar and screamed like one mad
if any entered or spoke&mdash;like mad did one say, but truly she was mad;
and Madame scarcely less mad.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>They had one more glimpse of Madame as they marched out, a glimpse
of her standing in a door and waving and calling something to the pipers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
as they came past. They knew or guessed what she wanted and the tune
they were playing swung abruptly into "The Gathering," and the battalion
tramped past the woman to the vengeful skirl of " ... flesh to the
eagles."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Affairs had not gone well with the battalion, or what was left of it, through
the battle. They had been ordered to advance and take a certain position
in what was supposed to be the flank, had forced their way forward over
the open under a scourging shell-fire, had suffered heavy losses, and at last
gained the point from which they were to make the final attacking rush.
But now that they were here it seemed impossible for men to go further
and live. A stretch of open still lay before them, and this was swept with
a tornado of rifle and machine-gun fire. What was supposed to be a flank
of the enemy had become a frontal position, strongly held and evidently
meant to be bitterly defended. It was vital to the success of the day that
it should be taken, for various tactical reasons we need not touch here.
The Colonel had passed the word through his officers and N.C.O.'s of what
they were needed to do, and, briefly, why and how much depended on
them.</p>

<p>The moment came.</p>

<p>A battalion on their left surged out and went plunging across
the open, the high-explosive shells bursting and flinging fountains of
spouting black earth and smoke amongst them, the ground puffing and
dust-spurting under the hailing bullets. The Highlanders were supposed
to wait until this other battalion had gained a certain line before they, the
Highlanders, attacked; so they lay in their ditch, watching the line struggle
forward and the men falling in swathes under the pouring fire, watched it
stop at last and drop flat and then begin to break back to cover. It was
no time to wait longer, and the Colonel, making up his mind swiftly, launched
his attack. It was met by a devastating storm of fire, even heavier and more
deadly than the one they had watched. The battalion, barely clear of their
cover, wilted under the storm, hesitated, stopped, and began to fire back
at the enemy they could not see. Those of the men who stood firing were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
cut down quickly, the others dropped prone or jumped into shell-holes
or such cover as they could find. The officers did their best, jumping up
and running forward and calling on their men to follow. But few of them
ran more than a score of paces before bullet or shell fragment found them,
and they fell; such men as rose and tried to follow only followed them
into the next world. The air was alive and trembling to the whistle and
whine and hiss of bullets, their snap and smack and crack, and to the quick
following crash on crash of the earth shaking shell-bursts.</p>

<p>Again some of the officers tried to rally and start the line forward; but,
by now, so great was the noise, so dense the air with smoke and dust, so
chaotic and confused the whole business, that the officers' attempts resulted
in no more than spasmodic and isolated movements of little groups, movements
that were worse than useless, because each could be dealt with in
detail, and, one after another, the sweeping machine-guns sluicing bullets
on each and cutting them to pieces in turn. Those that made these separate
attempts were mostly cut down; those that watched their failure were
more convinced than ever that the whole was useless.</p>

<p>The Colonel, too, saw that it was useless and vain slaughter unless by
some desperate chance the line should move together ... and even now
it was perhaps too late, because the battalion on the left, lying in the open
and scourged with fire, was giving way solidly and struggling back to cover.</p>

<p>It was a crisis in the battle, and where in the crisis many brave men
had failed, one brave man tried and won. From somewhere down the line
high over the roar of the battle there rose a wailing skirl of the pipes. There
was no note of the music that was not familiar to every man there, that
they did not know each word to fit to it. The pipes might have been crying
the very words aloud to them instead of the music:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"<em>Thro' the depths of Loch Katrine the steed shall career,</em></p>
<p class="verse"><em>O'er the peaks o' Ben Lomond the galley shall steer,</em></p>
<p class="verse"><em>And the rocks of Craig Royston like icicles melt</em></p>
<p class="verse"><em>Ere our wrongs be forgot, ere our vengeance unfelt.</em>"</p>
</div></div>

<p>It was the voice of their own Highlands, their own clansmen, their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
regiment, that was calling to those crouching men in the ditch. They
stirred, lifting their heads and looking for the piper. They could not see
him, but the pipes shrilled on:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"<em>Then gather, gather, gather ...</em>"</p>
</div></div>

<p>The men knew what was coming. "<em>Gather</em>" sang the pipes, and, when
they were ready gathered, the word or the sign would surely come. The
music was rousing them to other memories beyond their Scotland and their
name and fame in the Highlands. "<em>Landless, landless, landless</em>," cried
the pipes, and the men remembered those women back in the village, houseless
and homeless, tortured and shamed past telling, remembered too a
woman's final word, "But we are women and you are men."</p>

<p>Along the line the wild and useless fire was steadying and dying away;
they could see now that this was no time for shooting, but for the cold steel.
The Colonel saw and felt that the moment had come, rose crouching to his
knees, made ready to leap out and forward. He, too, had been looking for
the piper without seeing sign of him. But now, just as he rose,&mdash;"<em>Hulloo,
Hulloo ... Gregorlach!</em>" skirled the pipes, and down the line a figure
leaped from cover into full view, halted, marked time for a few steps to the
beat of the music, moved steadily forward, the kilt swaying, shoulders and
pipe drones swinging, streamers fluttering, and the pipes screaming their
hardest.</p>

<p>All along the line men were scrambling to their feet and into the open.
"<em> ... Gregorlach!</em>"</p>

<p>The Colonel was out and running forward, the line was up and away&mdash;"<em>Hulloo,
Gregorlach!</em>" and the pipe streamers still fluttering and dancing
ahead of the solid rushing wave of kilt and khaki and glinting steel. "<em>Give
their roofs to the flames....</em>"</p>

<p>In that rush many fell and died; but at the end of it so did many Germans.
For this time no bullet storm could stay the charge, the position was
reached and taken, and the cold steel came to its own again&mdash;came to its
own and drove home the meaning of the music that alone had brought it
there&mdash;"<em>Their flesh ... to the eagles.</em>"</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BLACK_CHANTER" id="THE_BLACK_CHANTER"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE BLACK CHANTER</a></h2>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">Charles Laing Warr</span></p>

<p class="noindent">It was April above Lucerne, in the year of grace nineteen hundred and
fourteen, and everything was young. A witchery of sunlight and scent and
blossom etherealised the earth and the heavens; and fields, green as the
green diamond at the heart of the world, rioted wantonly to kiss the white
dazzling peaks that glittered in the sapphire sky.</p>

<p>On a fallen tree, its bark all frosted with lichen, two young people sat
at the edge of a pine copse. They were both in the springtide of life, and
they sat in enchanted silence inhaling the perfume of the trees and listening
to the birth song of an awakening universe. She was not much over twenty,
perhaps, and she was enhaloed with the soul of France. It lurked in the
dark glistening coils of her hair, in the gestures of her shoulders and white,
nervous hands, her lips. Her eyes, half mystic, half tigerish, wells of lightly
slumbering passion, told the eternal story of that indomitable race whose
destiny it seems to have been to demonstrate to the world that the life of
a nation's soul may be unquenchable, though drowned in every century
with blood.</p>

<p>He was obviously from across the Channel; clean built, healthy and
handsome. One versed in the characteristic physiognomy of the denizens
of our islands would have told you after a moment's observation that he was
a Celt. And indeed, the Honourable Gordon Niall, son and heir of the
fifteenth Baron Niall of the Western Isles, could play the <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">piob mor</i> and
speak the Gaelic as his mother tongue. Twelve years of public school and
university life had left him still dreaming foolish dreams and seeing great
visions. Which is a proof that he was born into this world a trifle late.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>They were happy, these two, in their nest in the hills. They looked
out on the world as the good God made it. Among the flower-smothered
fields stretched at their feet a placid-minded peasantry lived and moved
and had their being. Content with their tree-bowered, log-built chalets
and their daily bread, they follow the slow-footed oxen and their wooden
ploughs, just as their fathers did a thousand years ago. From day to day
their stainless, uneventful life unfolds to them the secret of the untroubled
heart, and they believe in the beauty of the world they see and the goodness
of the Creator they one day hope to see. They are simple folk, of course.</p>

<p>Helene von Behr loved it as she looked. It made her remember so vividly
an old-age worn chateau in the peace of southern France. She felt again
in her inmost soul those scents of childhood which outlive all human forgetfulness.
She sat and dreamed of it all, and as she dreamed her thoughts
became words, and she told them to her companion, who listened with his
blue eyes full of a boyish unconcealed adoration for the lovely girl beside
him. Her eyes sometimes puzzled him; they puzzled him now. A sad,
lambent light was in them; like sunset glints on the shadowing hills of
vanished years.</p>

<p>She talked on: about the moat round the grey creeper-covered house,
the moat into which she had fallen one day when only six years old. And
the forest&mdash;so deep and dark and wonderful&mdash;with the great oak, into
whose branches Napoleon III. had climbed to smoke his everlasting cigarette
in peace when he had been the unwelcome guest of her great-uncle, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grand
seigneur</i> who had despised the new régime. Old Jean Barbé, the coachman,
was remembered too&mdash;old Jean, who was always cross but didn't mean to
be; and what a funny scar it was over his left eye where her white cat had
scratched him!</p>

<p>Then there was the village curé. She said, with simple innocence, that
her nurse had told her as a secret that it was whispered he was her uncle,
and would have reigned in the chateau had he only travelled into this life
down the broad road which leadeth from the altar. But, what a dear he
was! She remembered when she made her first confession to him, and how
she had wondered if he was smiling, or angry, behind the grating when she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
told that she had stolen a cigarette from the big silver box on the writing-table
of M. le Vicomte de Fontaigne, her father, and had smoked it surreptitiously
in the stable beside her pet horse. He used to dine with them
every Wednesday evening; and in the calm summer night the table was
laid beneath the pear tree at the end of the terrace near the river, which
glowed so red in the light of the westering sun. How shabby his soutane
always was, and all brown with the stains of snuff!</p>

<p>So she rambled on and spoke of her father, that proud aristocrat, bearing
a name to be found in the most abbreviated histories. She laughed when
she said that he lived there in magnificent isolation, too proud to serve the
Republic!</p>

<p>Then she sighed, and did not tell that nevertheless he had married
her against her will to that dull old German diplomatist sitting down there
in the Schweizerhof immersed in the voluminous correspondence which was
the breath of his life: that correspondence which she secretly blessed in
her heart for the free, careless hours it had given her these last ten days
with this fresh-faced boy, the only occupant of the scantily filled hotel
with whom her lord and master would allow her to associate.</p>

<p>She sat silent, and gazed dreamily at the undulating countryside, radiant
in bloom and light and colour, with old Pilatus in the distance, sentinel
of ages. The shimmering sunshine quivered all over it, and the scattered
chalets, and orchards pink and white with foam, seemed lulled to sleep
in the security of God. Once a priest passed, trudging down the white
dusty road beneath; once a peasant, the smoke of his long black cigar
hanging in a blue filmy wreath about his round felt hat. Far down in the
valley tinkled the music of cow bells. A little stream, crystal clear, trickled
at her feet ... flies danced in clouds above the edging rushes. The warm
smell of the earth was intoxicating like incense....</p>

<p>She was dimly conscious that her companion was whistling softly.
He had a habit of doing this when deep in thought, and she recognised
the odd little refrain. She had heard him whistle it a dozen times&mdash;queer,
uncanny, elusive as the mountain mist, with the mystery of the hills in it,
and sorrow, and the spirit of brave men. She glanced at him. She knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
that this boy had begun to exercise a strange fascination over her, stronger
and more dangerous than she dared to confess even to herself. It was
not unnatural, for her life these last three years in that grim, dull old schloss
in Hanover had been very lonely. The bud will not mate with the yellow
leaf, but spring must call to spring; albeit the mongers of the matrimonial
market prattle as they please.</p>

<p>"What is it you whistle, my Gordon?" she asked suddenly. "There
are strange things in the air. Has it a story from your Scottish hills?"</p>

<p>He sat back and laughed his gay laugh.</p>

<p>"Yes, it has," he answered. "I'll tell it you, if it won't bore you."</p>

<p>"But no: tell me," she said, and prepared to listen, her chin in her
hand.</p>

<p>It was a tune they played on the pipes, he said: and it was a wild,
barbaric story of war and the fierce passion of men and the tottering fortunes
of his race. Six hundred years ago Castle Niall had been besieged by a
neighbouring clan, for the Niall of the day had carried off the daughter of
its chief, and held her within his walls. The beleaguered garrison was on the
verge of starvation, when to Niall came a dream which told him that deliverance
would come from a black chanter which would drop from heaven upon
the castle roof. Three times, and three times only, would it play a mysterious
tune, which none but the head of the house would be able to awaken from
the reed; and in the hour of peril or distress the playing of the chanter would
bring salvation. When the morning dawned grey over the castle ramparts,
they found, lying on the roof, a black chanter as had been foretold. The
chief blew on it with trembling lips, and lo! it played of its own accord.
Immediately Niall and his men sallied from the fortress and drove their
enemies into the sea.</p>

<p>In the intervening centuries the chanter had again been used and brought
deliverance. Its virtue would be efficacious only once more. The strange,
haunting air had become the battle charge of his race. It was that which
he had been whistling. The last time it had been played, in the sixteenth
century, the family piper had caught the air and fixed it indelibly on the
scroll of memory. He laughed nervously when he had finished. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
afraid she would treat it lightly. But he had told his tale with an old-world
seriousness, and although she had felt inclined to smile when he had ended
his recital of it, something in his face restrained her. Instead, she patted
his brown curly head.</p>

<p>"Come," she said, "it is late. We must go home."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was their last evening together, for Helene and her husband were
leaving the following day. As they walked along under the chestnut trees
on the Schweizerhof Quai, Niall was dull and silent. She had stirred the
very depths of his young, impressionable heart, this girl. He didn't attempt
to deceive himself: he knew he was passionately in love with her. He felt
that he hated old von Behr. But&mdash;it was all so hopeless.</p>

<p>That night he dined with them. The dinner was not a great success.
They were all pre-occupied&mdash;Helene and Gordon with crowding thoughts
that were very much akin, the Count with a disquieting dispatch from the
Wilhelmstrasse and a severe attack of indigestion. At ten o'clock he excused
himself: he had writing to do. He pointedly suggested that his
wife should go to bed; and he made his adieux to Niall, remarking that
they were leaving early in the morning and would not likely see him. Furious
with stifled anger, the boy said a conventional good-bye to the woman
he loved. She moved away. Count von Behr lingered for a moment, and
then betook himself with shambling gait to his accustomed corner of the
writing-room, which, for some reason, he preferred to his own private apartment.</p>

<p>The moment he was out of sight Niall hurriedly left the lounge and
hastened upstairs. On the first floor he saw her, obviously lingering, a
little way down the corridor. She came back as she saw him approach.
The boy blushed deeply as he took her hand, and stammered something
about not being able to say good-bye in such a beastly cold fashion. His
head seemed to be swimming. He had some confused impressions about
the white of her evening gown and a great crimson rose at her breast.</p>

<p>"My Gordon," she said softly, with that fascinating inability to control
her r's that thrilled him; "Whistle me your tune once again&mdash;quickly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
for I must go. I shall remember you by it, boy. Perhaps, some day if
we meet again, I may be able to whistle it to you!"</p>

<p>She smiled, but her eyes were moist. And Niall drew his parched lips
together and managed to whistle the strange, mysterious air. He finished
and stood awkwardly facing her, tall and distinguished in his evening
clothes. No word of love had ever passed between them, but as they looked
into each other's eyes, each read the secret that nothing could hide.</p>

<p>"Adieu, my Gordon," she whispered hastily. "You have been good
to me. I won't forget you ... and you'll help me often ... but be
sensible, boy&mdash;and forget me!"</p>

<p>A moment later she was running down the corridor and vanished at the
end. The boy stood for a minute or two rigid where he was, staring blankly
at a red rose in his hands, his head reeling with the delicious joy of the
knowledge that for one never-to-be-forgotten moment her arms had been
thrown round his neck, and on his mouth her warm lips had pressed a
swift, burning kiss.</p>


<p class="p1 center">II</p>

<p>Captain Gordon Niall of the Uist Highlanders lay flat on his face beside
a loophole in the wall. With a subaltern, two men, and a stray sergeant of
the Yorkshire Rifles, he occupied the remains of a former farmstead, now
a jumbled heap of bricks and mortar. The only portion of this mass of
refuse that looked like a house was a right angle formed by the ends of
two walls which rose like a skeleton from the shattered piles of rafters, rubbish,
stones, lime, and dead bodies of mangled men.</p>

<p>It was one of the supreme moments resultant upon the German break
through near Armentières, that grim, bloody month of April, 1918. The
British line existed only in the imagination of an exhausted and bewildered
Staff, their faculties half paralysed with fatigue and over work. No one
knew with anything even approaching certainty what the situation was.
Only one thing was certain because it was obvious, and that was that the
very existence of our Armies was hanging in the balance. The British front
was hopelessly, irretrievably broken; and a disorganised rabble of tattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
regiments, half crazy with weariness and strain and hunger, were retreating
in mixed, irregular bands back from the river Lys, through a withering
hail of bullets and a raging tornado of shrapnel and high explosive; valiantly
and uncomplainingly to take up new positions and renew the desperate
struggle against overwhelming odds.</p>

<p>Gordon Niall had arrived at the stage when all emotion had been frozen
to its depths. He looked phlegmatically out upon a dreary, muddy countryside
literally alive with the grey advancing hordes of the enemy. The little
group huddled in the shelter of the tottering walls manipulated a Lewis
gun with the dull ceaseless energy of men in a dream. Dirty, ragged, verminous,
with a week's growth on their smoke-grimed emaciated faces,
they were unquestioningly carrying out to the last their final act in the
mighty drama of that last awful month which clouded their minds like
a nightmare from Hell.</p>

<p>They had been all through the sickening horror of the struggle on the
Somme, and after three weeks hard fighting had arrived a week ago at
Armentières for a rest, to find themselves swirled into the vortex of the
new German offensive. Gordon Niall as he stoically waited for death,
knew very little about the facts of it all. He had been told that the Portuguese
who held the line on the left had broken; and that out of the welter
of shattered, scurrying, disordered units, he had been ordered to take up
an advanced position, to stem the rush with a handful of men he had managed
to gather round him out of the retreating forces. And there he was, with
four others&mdash;all that were left&mdash;with the German masses two hundred yards
ahead, and behind him the river Lys, its muddy waters splashing under the
bursting barrage, ironically emphasising the fact that for him there was no
retreat.</p>

<p>It was only a matter of minutes, and at last the end came. A confused
babel of sounds; a smothering avalanche of men, stamping, yelling, pushing;
the collapse of the whole universe about him; a deadly pain in his
head; a strange, swift, kaleidoscopic vision of home ... his mother's
face ... then darkness.</p>

<p>He didn't know how long afterwards it was that he felt himself jerked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
roughly to his feet. As his senses slowly returned he realised that a German
officer was searching him. He watched the man stupidly as he went through
the papers in his pocket-book: then something fell from a letter to the
ground, something brown like a dead leaf, and Niall lurched forward with
a snarl.</p>

<p>"Give it me!" he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>The officer looked up, surprised, and then down at his feet. He stooped
and picked the little fragment from the ground, glanced at it casually,
and handed it to Niall with a look of half amused wonder in his eyes. Then
he went on reading. Niall thrust the recovered treasure into his tunic
pocket&mdash;only a faded rose given to him four years ago by a girl at Lucerne,
whose memory the passion of war had not succeeded in effacing.</p>

<p>The officer soon finished, and Niall was marched off with a small escort.
It all seemed like a bad dream, that scurry over the fire-swept zone, the
arrival at the battered hamlet where more prisoners were waiting. Then
the long weary march, hour after hour, their numbers constantly swelling,
on through the fading twilight and a dark drizzling night. Like drunken
men the straggling column reeled along, half delirious with hunger and
fatigue, past stores and camps and dumps and villages, while ever past them
the reserve masses of horse, foot and artillery incessantly pressed on the
heels of the advancing German forces. At last, long after midnight, they
reached a smallish town; and, packed into an empty building, they fell
on the cold concrete floor and slept the sleep of utter exhaustion.</p>

<p>Early in the morning they were marched to the station, and Niall found
himself in a third class compartment with eleven other officers. Some time
before the train started a bowl of some sticky, soupy substance was handed
in, with a loaf of bread; and on this they subsisted during the twenty-six
hours which elapsed before they were detrained at their destination, a
dreary, drab little town; and, cramped and weak as children, they marched
two miles out into the country to the wire-encircled encampment which
awaited their coming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>


<p class="p1 center">III</p>

<p>Those unfortunates who endured the lonely monotonous horror of prison
life in Germany will tell you what "barbed-wire madness" was. They will
tell you of men who got the disease; and of that furtive, piteous look that
haunted the tragic sunken eyes of weary creatures who became frenzied
with the longing for freedom. It is perhaps difficult to appreciate from the
depths of an arm-chair the terrible gnawing pain of this consuming passion
to which some natures were so very susceptible. But strong men who have
lived, if only just lived, for three long ghastly months, without letters or
parcels, on a diet of turnip-soup and small lumps of black bread, till the
skin was stretched tight over their protruding cheek-bones like yellow
parchment, their filthy, ragged clothes hanging like mildewed sacks on their
emaciated bodies, and their hollow eyes gleaming like the eyes of famished
beasts&mdash;they understand how easy it was to fall a prey to "barbed-wire
madness."</p>

<p>Gordon Niall got it, and got it badly. It was inevitable. The restless
Celtic spirit was the first to fall a victim to the mania for escape. Five
times he eluded his watchful guard, and five times was recaptured, sullen
and still determined, taking his punishment of solitary confinement as a
matter of course, with a purpose dogged and unbroken. For solitary confinement
in cells was no cure for the disease: it was like malaria, once in the
system it was ineradicable. The weeks dragged on. Parcels and letters
arrived from home and conditions gradually improved, but Niall remained
obsessed with his yearning for liberty. Other men who had escaped and
been recaptured began to realise the futility of it, and the news which
filtered through the German newspapers of the turn of the tide and the
progress of the Allied forces tended to encourage them to settle down to
await developments. And one night the camp was electrified with the
announcement of the defection of Bulgaria. It was the beginning of the
end, and the star of hope shone clear in the firmament. Yet it had no
effect on Gordon Niall, for the following night he made yet another attempt
to escape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>He had thought it out carefully; and at midnight, three friends, strenuously
protesting at his foolishness, hoisted him up to the little window
of their hut which overlooked the prison yard. It was not more than twelve
yards from the wire enclosure, and within four feet of it rose a telegraph
pole. The window had been very carefully prepared, and it did not take
Niall many minutes to remove the glass, drop the panes into the keeping
of his friends below, and wriggle on to the narrow ledge. He listened carefully,
and looked up and down the yard, white in the searching glare of the
great electric lamps which turned night into day. A high wind and a driving
sleet favoured him, for the sentry who passed shortly afterwards on his beat
by the barbed wire was walking quickly with his chin sunk in the collar of
his coat. Niall waited till he had gone, then, crouching for a moment on
the window ledge, he sprang forward, clutched at the telegraph pole, clung
to it for a few seconds, then laboriously hauled himself up to the cross-bars.
Here he rested for a while and allowed the sentry once more to pass. Then,
judging that he would just have time to reach the further pole, which was
a few feet on the far side of the wire, before the man returned, he commenced
his perilous journey. Painfully and cautiously he straddled across the wires
and began to work himself along. The swirling blasts of the strong wind
more than once almost swept him from his precarious hold, and the icy rain
numbed his cut and bleeding hands. Beneath his weight the wires swayed
and sagged ... yet he struggled on his desperate way. It was more
difficult than he had supposed, and sick, with nervous strain and physical
exhaustion, he determined to risk discovery and hang where he was, halfway
across, until the sentry passed again. The minutes dragged, and then
round the corner of the next hut the man appeared, his shoulders hunched
in the driving rain, his eyes on the ground. Above him, clinging frantically
to the wire, Niall waited, his heart in his mouth. The man walked almost
beneath him, seeing nothing; and in a few seconds the prisoner again began
to toil along the wires. At length, almost fainting with fatigue and strain,
he clutched his goal and drew himself across the cross-bars, and waited,
panting, his heart throbbing as if it would burst, until the sentry should
repass him. He soon approached. Nearer and nearer he came. He tramped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
beneath the crouching figure on the top of the telegraph pole. Niall muttered
a prayer of thankfulness for the fierce wind and the torrential rain.</p>

<p>The blood suddenly roared in his ears with excitement ... the man had
stopped ... was he going to look up?... he stamped his feet for a
minute or two, then resumed his monotonous beat.</p>

<p>Niall quickly clutched the pole with his arms and knees and slithered
to the ground. Bending low he ran swiftly across the area illumined by the
glare from the prison yard, and found himself in the enveloping darkness
of the night.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The fugitive had a roughly accurate knowledge of the immediate countryside,
gained by constant observation during the occasional walks which had
been permitted the prisoners, under escort. He purposed making for a thick
wood which lay about two miles to the westward, and there concealing himself
during the following day when the hue and cry would be in full swing.
When night again came round he would push ahead; if possible, keeping
a general course to the north-west, which, he anticipated, would in time
bring him to some point on the Dutch frontier. He had saved up a quantity
of food, which, with strict economy, he hoped might last him at a pinch
for a fortnight. If, by that time, he had not reached the frontier, things
might become awkward; but this was an eventuality too distant to be
considered at the moment.</p>

<p>He found himself at the outskirts of the forest an hour later, and forged
ahead through the crowding trees and thick undergrowth until dawn broke,
when he searched about for a secure hiding-place. He resolved not to climb
a tree as he felt that sleep was a necessity. Fortune favoured him by the
discovery of a large fox-hole in a dense thicket; and down this he forced
his way feet first, carefully wound up his wrist watch, and in five minutes
was fast asleep.</p>

<p>It was one o'clock in the afternoon when he awoke. Scarcely a sound
broke the tense silence of the wood. The rain had passed and the sun shone
clear above the trees. He ate some biscuits and a meagre slice of tinned
meat, washed his face and hands in a neighbouring stream, made some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
rough calculations on a sheet of paper as to direction, and settled down
to wait for nightfall. With the advent of dusk he again set off through the
forest.</p>

<p>For twelve long weary days and nights he successfully eluded capture
and kept up the same monotonous round&mdash;hiding by day and pushing ahead
by night. He had been forced on many occasions to retrace his steps or
make circuitous rounds owing to coming suddenly on villages or towns, and
he had not made the progress he had resolved to make. His food, too,
he had miscalculated; and at the close of the twelfth day he found himself
with his rations at an end, and hopelessly befogged as to his whereabouts.
For another day and night he held out bravely, and then narrowly avoided
detection in a fruitless attempt to steal a chicken from a farmyard. At
the expiry of a fortnight he was starving and in the throes of a fever.</p>

<p>He came to a final decision. He would start again at dusk and press on.
If by daylight there was no sign of the frontier he would give himself up.
There was nothing else for it. He was in desperate straits: his clothes
were torn to rags and he was almost overcome by the fierce grip of the fever
that was rapidly consuming his little remaining strength. He had given up
all hope of winning to the haven of neutral territory; it might not be far
away, perhaps, but his power of endurance was at an end. However, he
would forge ahead that night, whatever happened.</p>

<p>As soon as darkness rendered it safe he emerged from his concealment
and struck westward along the edge of a rough country road. For hours
he toiled along meeting with nobody, but making poor progress. He was
becoming light-headed, and he lurched heavily as he walked. At intervals
he burned and shivered and sweated fiercely. Time and again he fell on his
face, but on each occasion he staggered to his feet and struggled ahead.</p>

<p>The night wore on, and through the clouds on the eastern skyline a
palish light began to filter. The skies grew dull grey and then softer like
the wing of a dove. Over the fields and hedgerows the luminous glow grew
clearer as the wheels of the Dawn rolled on, touching the bare branches of
the trees and silvering the green stagnant water in the ditch, by whose
edge reeled and pitched an exhausted atom of humanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>Niall raised his bloodshot eyes to the heavens.</p>

<p>"Well, this is the end of it," he muttered, "and probably the end of
me too. I don't mind ... it's been a good effort, and I'm so tired ...
my God, how tired I am!"</p>

<p>A hundred yards ahead a high wall began, evidently the bound of some
large country residence, and not much further on was a small iron gate.
Inside, a footpath led winding among the trees of a wide parkland. With
shaking hands Niall unlatched the gate and followed the path. He could
not see now where he was going: a red mist hung like a veil before his
eyes. Once he ran against a tree, striking his head violently against the
trunk. Dazedly he raised his hand to his forehead and felt it wet....
Shortly afterwards he reached the end of the parkland. Things grew clearer
again, and he saw before him, not three hundred yards away, the grey
battlemented towers of a stately castle. For a few moments he stared at
it in a fuddled manner, then he collapsed into a ditch full of rotting leaves.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When he regained consciousness it was night. He must have lain there
all day. Slowly past events came back to him, and he raised himself with
difficulty on his elbow and looked at the winking lights in the castle windows.
The fever did not trouble him now: all he was conscious of was a fierce,
overpowering craving for food and warmth and rest. The twinkle of the
lights called to him. It was a German house, certainly, but he would get
something to eat there, and they would let him rest&mdash;how he wanted rest!
His thoughts flew back to his home in the distant western isles. Would
they be thinking of him? he wondered. Thank God, they couldn't see him
now. His mother, and Eileen his sister ... they would be in the old library
where they always sat at night, that vast stone-walled room above the
cliff where the moaning of the sea rose eternally. And his father would be
asleep in the red leather chair by the gun-room fire. He smiled as the
vision rose before him. Would he ever see it again? Great God, why did
men want to kill one another?...</p>

<p>His rambling thoughts switched off in another direction ... if they
could see him now, perhaps his old father would go to the glass case on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
library wall, take from its resting place the black chanter, and blow on it
for the last time! He laughed hoarsely&mdash;a good joke that! Delirious and
cracked, his voice suddenly croaked forth the weird notes of the
black chanter's tune. Horrible and broken it rose on the still night air.</p>

<p>In a few moments the delirium passed, and with a mighty effort he got
on his hands and knees. Painfully and slowly he began to crawl across
the damp grass of the park towards the shadowy mass of the silent castle.</p>

<p>"They'll give me food," he gasped ... "and let me rest."</p>


<p class="p1 center">IV</p>

<p>The Countess von Behr sat in a deep chair by the open fireplace of her
boudoir in the Schloss Bersenburg. On the white marble mantelshelf a
painted china clock pointed to a quarter past eleven. The luxuriously
furnished room was in deep shadow, the only light coming from two massive
silver candelabra upon the grand piano in a recess by the window. The
flickering glow from the red embers lit up fitfully the face of the woman who
gazed abstractedly into the fire.</p>

<p>Four years of mental strain and suffering had left their mark on Helene
von Behr, for there were lines about her eyes and her mouth had grown
harder. These years had fallen with tragic weight upon the shoulders of
the exiled girl, doomed by the exigencies of the times to live alone in this
vast gloomy house, her heart in bleeding France, her body in a country
which by hereditary instinct she had always disliked, but now hated with
all the intensity of her passionate southern heart. So she had dragged out
her solitary days in the seclusion of the Schloss, one of that vast multitude,
young in years but old in suffering, whose souls have been ruthlessly crushed
beneath the iron wheels of the chariots of war.</p>

<p>The Count had been keenly alive to the delicacy of his domestic situation,
and from the outbreak of hostilities, though he had been almost constantly
resident in Berlin owing to his important connection with the Foreign
Office, he had deemed it the prudent course to leave his French wife in the
solitariness of his country home; a policy which saved both himself and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
from inevitable embarrassments which might at once prove detrimental
to the interests of the one, and intolerable to the other.</p>

<p>The unutterable agony of the weary months in a position which was
both false and horrible to her, conscious as she could not fail to be of the
veiled contempt and cleverly concealed hostility of her servants, and the
less disguised dislike of her few neighbours, had told heavily upon the
lonely woman. Two months ago things had become almost insufferable
when the news came that the Vicomte de Fontaigne had been laid in a soldier's
grave. To fight for the Republic was one thing, but to fight for France
was quite another: and so, at the hour of crisis, like the rest of his order,
the haughty nobleman had put his politics in his pocket and offered his
services to the Govermnent. The grief of her father's death, borne alone,
friendless and exiled, had almost crushed Helene. Yet it seemed as if her
perplexities were never to end: for that very afternoon a telegram had
come intimating in crude staring words, that the Count von Behr had been
shot dead in the Wilhelmstrasse while endeavouring from a window to
appease a revolutionary mob.</p>

<p>She had tried to analyse her feelings when the news was conveyed to her.
She had never loved him, but in his own blunt way he had been kind and
considerate to her; and the sudden tears which she shed were from the
heart, for she sincerely regretted his death. Yet despite this fact she could
not stifle the insistent thought that she was free&mdash;free to go back to France
and to the Chateau Fontaigne, that pearl of her soul, when this holocaust
of death was past and over; a thought rendered doubly moving by the
knowledge that the dawn was already breaking! She had often wondered
what it would be like in the future for a child of France to be wedded for
ever to a German.</p>

<p>As she sat before the fire she felt restless and ill at ease. Her jumbled
thoughts refused to be focussed on any one aspect of her affairs. She felt
something strange in the atmosphere, something that oppressed her. It
seemed in the air, it was all around, real yet indefinable. Time and again
she looked round half nervously as if expecting to find someone in the room
with her....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>She settled deeper into her chair and listlessly watched a morsel that
fell red from the fire ... it grew pink and then grey. It still smoked a
little, then died. As the lonely woman stared into the embers there suddenly
rose before her a boyish face, so clear and vivid that she was startled
by it. There was pain in the eyes that looked at her, pain and dull weariness,
and the dumb suffering of a yearning spirit. Helene shivered....
How often during these last years had that face risen before her, and the
sunlight and happiness of ten brief days in a deserted Lucerne had fallen
on her tired heart like the dew of heaven. She had never forgotten him&mdash;how
could she? She had wondered so often where he was. She knew he
was not dead: for he was first in that list of names which she had given
to a friend in Berne, desiring him to keep her acquainted with their fortunes.
She often thought, had she done wrong that night when she kissed his
young mouth? But it didn't really matter, after all: she had done him
no harm, and long ago he would have forgotten her. Men forgot so quickly.
For his own sake she hoped he had: yet&mdash;in spite of herself she prayed that
he hadn't. And as she looked ahead, to-night, to her coming liberty, she
wondered.... But the face in the fire made her uneasy. A queer tune
throbbed in her head&mdash;his tune! She had heard it in her thoughts all night;
wild, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'unrythmical'">unrhythmical</ins>, it seemed to have vibrated in the stillness of the shadowy
room&mdash;mysterious, passionate, compelling. Once it had been so realistic
that she had been convinced that she actually heard it&mdash;out in the night;
and she had pulled aside the curtains and peered out into the darkness.</p>

<p>She stretched her arms above her head. She felt stifled: surely the
room was very hot. Rising, she moved restlessly to the window and looked
out. It was a clear, starry night; with a silver moon peeping from behind
some scudding clouds. She lingered, gazing up at the beauty of the heavens.
Then, just as she was about to let the thick curtain drop, suddenly, muffled
yet distinct, she heard a man's voice rise on the night air. It cried one
English word&mdash;"Help!"</p>

<p>For a minute she stood startled and irresolute, then she flung open the
window. Below, on the white of the wide gravel sweep, she could dimly
see a dark form lying stretched before the massive steps of the doorway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
She leaned over the edge and called. No answer came. She
drew back into the room and touched the electric bell. A few seconds
later, an old sleepy-eyed footman appeared, their last remaining manservant.</p>

<p>"Quick," she cried, "there is a man lying outside on the gravel. I
think he is dead. Get some help and bring him into the hall. I'll come
down myself immediately."</p>

<p>The man bowed solemnly and withdrew; and when five minutes later
she descended the broad oak staircase, Helene saw an excited knot of
servants depositing a human burden on the great fur rug before the cavernous
hall fireplace. She approached and looked down upon the form of a man,
little more than a skeleton, his clothes ragged and smeared with filth, his
thin sunken face bearded and dirty. The cluster of servants stared at
him open-mouthed.</p>

<p>The sick man moved an arm. He drowsily muttered a few words;
feebly, but Helene and the domestics heard them:</p>

<p>"Must be near the frontier now.... Thank God!"</p>

<p>"English," said the old footman resentfully, but a quick look from his
mistress silenced any further remark. She despatched the man for the
local doctor and sent the women for blankets, hot water, brandy, pillows;
and she herself knelt by the miserable creature and gently loosened his
ragged collar. The emaciated face recalled nothing to her as she looked&mdash;but,
a few seconds later, Gordon Niall opened his eyes, and, trembling like an
aspen leaf, and white to the lips, Helene von Behr recognised him.</p>

<p>"Mother of God!" she gasped.</p>

<p>The floodgates of memory opened and the great waters poured over her
soul. She felt the walls and the floor of the vast gloomy hall reeling about
her; but, with an almost superhuman effort of will, she regained her composure,
and met the eyes that looked into her ashen face with a look of
wonder and amazement. The fever seemed to have left him, and for the
moment Niall was perfectly conscious. She bent down and pillowed his head
on her arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>"Helene," he whispered, "is it you?... where am I?"</p>

<p>"It's all right, dear," she said soothingly. "You're quite safe. Don't
speak&mdash;you must rest."</p>

<p>The servants returned and Niall was made as comfortable as possible.
Helene thought rapidly. At all costs she must be alone with him for a time.
She dismissed the whispering women upon various errands. Yes, she said
to their enquiries, she would stay with him till they returned.</p>

<p>When they were alone Niall looked up.</p>

<p>"I escaped, you know," he said weakly. "I've had an awful time&mdash;but
I'm safe now, Helene, am I not?... across the frontier, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, my Gordon," she answered, smoothing back his matted hair,
"you're across the frontier, and you'll soon be well." She almost choked
as she remembered that the frontier was only five miles away.</p>

<p>He sighed contentedly and closed his eyes. For a while he lay very
still; then he spoke, with difficulty.</p>

<p>"My left tunic pocket," he gasped, "feel in it, Helene ... that's
right ... now, open that flap."</p>

<p>From the tattered leather pocket-book she pulled out a dried withered
flower. His eyes gleamed as he saw it. He turned his face to her.</p>

<p>"Your rose," he whispered&mdash;"at Lucerne, you know."</p>

<p>A severe fit of shivering seized him. His eyes closed. From the corners
of his mouth two thin rivulets of blood began to trickle ... he opened
his eyes.</p>

<p>"Helene," he muttered spasmodically, "Helene&mdash;the frontier ... I
must get across the frontier ... before the morning."</p>

<p>The end was near and she knew it. With her left hand she extracted
from her bosom a little gold crucifix and held it before the dying eyes.
In a voice, choked with emotion, she said in his ear,</p>

<p>"Say after me, my Gordon ... 'Jesu, have mercy!'"</p>

<p>"<em>Jesu&mdash;have&mdash;mercy!</em>"</p>

<p>"Now, and in the hour of death"&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>Now, and&mdash;in&mdash;the hour of&mdash;death</em>"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have mercy on me, a sinner!"</p>

<p>"<em>Have mercy&mdash;on&mdash;me&mdash;a sinner!</em>"&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>He shivered as in a blast of icy wind, then smiled like a tired child and
nestled his head against her breast. And very quietly he crossed the silent
frontier of that shadowy country, whence no traveller returns.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The servants were clustered about her, and the stout village doctor
was bending over the thin body stretched on the fur rug; but Helene, her
head bowed, neither looked up nor spoke....</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PIPES" id="THE_PIPES"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE PIPES</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Edmund Candler</span></p>


<p class="noindent">On Christmas night the pipers came into the mess. They had piped the
regiment across many a hot place in France and escorted bombing parties
down many a German trench. In one action four out of the eight were hit
and two killed. They touch a chord deep down somewhere which no doubt
has its proper scientific name. The eye of the piper which conceals his
gladness, denying all rapture, is a key to the undemonstrative temper of
the men who would rather die than throw up their bonnets and shout.</p>

<p>A subaltern of nineteen years put the case for the pipes to me in his own
eloquent slang.</p>

<p>"Of course I get cold feet sometimes" he said, "like everyone else.
But the pipes soon warm one. MacFarlane, the Company Piper, piped us
across on the 25th, the regimental slogan, you know. By Jove, it was top-hole."</p>

<p>We called him the Chicken. Being bigger in the beam than in the
shoulders and having a slightly forward stoop he looked in his kilt like a
preternaturally large nestling just emerged from the egg. To see him
walking reminded one of a determined young chicken. He had an assurance
unnatural in the new-born which set off his callowness and puzzled one.
It was not side. To hear him talk made one smile. You would think he
had plumbed experience and was already convinced about the main issues
of life, celibacy or marriage, the rights and wrongs of Demos, peace and war,
and the like. One smiled in sympathy, not in derision, accepting the indisputable
explanation that the Chicken had had special privileges in the egg.
And one thanked the war for an ingenuousness of speech, the bloom of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
which would have been rubbed off in a week of peace-time conditions in a
mess.</p>

<p>"MacFarlane was killed with a bombing party," the subaltern went on.
"They let hell loose,&mdash;all their machine guns, rifle grenades, trench mortars,
and every rifle thirty rounds at least. Our fellows came in half an hour
afterwards, having been snug in a <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'shell-hope'">shell-hole</ins> through the whole show. Only
two of our men were hit&mdash;by a trench mortar. One was MacFarlane. It
was a horrid sight&mdash;made me feel a bit green. Nothing was left of them,
and you couldn't tell who they were save by their identity discs. I put a
sentry by the traverse on both sides and gave orders that no one was to pass.
It wouldn't have done for these young recruits to see the mess," this pink-faced
subaltern of nineteen explained with paternal solicitude.</p>

<p>His tenderness for the recruits amused me, for the absence of down on
his chin made the Chicken look younger than his years. But I marvelled
more at the complacency with which he found himself in command. He
spoke of his blooded veterans&mdash;Perthshires, if you please, the salt of the
British Army, as if he were a huntsman holding them in the leash; yet it
was only in spirit that he had attained to man's estate. One phrase struck
me. He was describing the capture of Hun murderers, or if not actual
murderers the comrades and accomplices of murderers, men whom his
Highlanders wanted to kill.</p>

<p>"They were all holding up their hands," the boy told me, "and trembling
with funk and holding out pictures of their Fraus and kids, and calling out
'Don't shoot, Kamarade! Don't shoot!' and my men wanted to shoot
them. The Perthshires had been out for blood since the 9th of May when
the Huns had burnt their wounded comrades, shooting them with petrol
bullets so that their clothes burst into flame and they died in agony, and men
who couldn't stick the sight of it any longer crept out of their trenches, in
spite of orders, to drag them in and were burnt alive too. That day my
company swore that they would take no more Prussian prisoners, and now
word had been passed round by the Brigade, 'The 15th Prussians are in
front of you, who burnt the men of your regiment. You will know how to
behave.' My men wanted to shoot them all down, make the place a shambles;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
but, of course, I wouldn't have it. I told them they had to take the men
prisoners."</p>

<p>"Did they obey you?" I asked.</p>

<p>The Nestling looked at me in surprise as if I were a very ignorant person.</p>

<p>"Obey! They knew very well that the first man who fired I'd blow out
his brains with my revolver."</p>

<p>After all, the Chicken's assurance was a compliment to the regiment,
where discipline is an elemental fact. And it spoke well for the boy too,
that he realized what admission into that Kingdom, or corporation, meant,&mdash;all
self and chickenhood being merged in the subaltern of the Perthshires,
whose powers were as natural and inalienable as the properties of carbon or
oxygen.</p>

<p>Yet this callow youth on whom authority sat so lightly spurned his
profession. It appeared that he had ambitions. He scoffed at the idea
of sticking in the army after the war. He wanted "to do something," he
said. I could not understand how he could resist the glamour of it all.
His Colonel thought well of him and he knew it. The O.C., a reserved man,
and sparing of praise, had been talking to me about the Chicken before dinner;
he told me that the boy had the right spirit and no fear in him. "I sent him
on a patrol," he said, "a day or two after he arrived at the front, to a building
between the lines which was supposed to be occupied by Germans. My
orders were, 'Find out if the house is held. Find out for yourself, remember,
and don't take your men's word for it. They'll always see Germans,
especially on a wet night when they want to be snug in the trenches.'"</p>

<p>The Subaltern had the sight of an owl, but he was determined not to come
back until he had seen Germans. So far he had seen none, having arrived
at the trenches straight from Winchester, where he held a commission in the
O.T.C. and had just won a scholarship for New College. He swore he would
see Germans that night or promenade the empty house between the lines.</p>

<p>A slip of a moon showed above the clouds and the rain ceased when they
were within fifty yards of the building. The Corporal touched the Subaltern's
sleeve and said, "They're there, Sir. I can see about a dozen of
them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where? I don't see."</p>

<p>"Straight ahead, Sir, by the wall."</p>

<p>The Chicken approached nearer. Within forty&mdash;thirty yards. The
Corporal warned him again in a throaty whisper:&mdash;"There's 'arf a company,
Sir, lining the side of the house. We're almost agin them."</p>

<p>Still the Chicken could not see. He gave the order to move forward.</p>

<p>At fifteen yards the Germans opened fire. A quick volley. The patrol
threw themselves flat. Luckily they were concealed in a slight depression,
and in a few seconds the moon went under a dark cloud.</p>

<p>The Subaltern whispered the order to return the enemy's fire, and his
four men blazed away into the shadow under the house. The Germans
replied vigorously; by a miracle none of the little party were hit. Then
the Huns turned the machine gun on to them from somewhere farther back.
The Subaltern heard the spray of bullets coming nearer, spattering the earth,
searching every inch of soil, passing with a thirsty sucking noise overhead.
He was the most exposed of his party, but he felt for the body of the dead
man he had stumbled against, and drew it into a close embrace. The
current of lead passed an inch over them where they lay interlaced, the live
man clinging for life to the dead. The fire dropped. The body received a
bullet and shook as if it were wrestling with him. Its head butted his own.
A faint smell of cigar fume clung to its moustache. The boy had let the
situation go for a moment, and was wondering, with a detachment at which
he was surprised, whether all Germans smoked Havanas in the trenches,
when a new kind of explosion added to the din. It was "A" Company's
patrol bombing the house. The little scouting party received their first
casualty from them. The man behind the Chicken uttered a cry of pain.
A splinter from a bomb had taken away part of his right ear.</p>

<p>This extended attack was too much for the Huns, who thought the
whole line was advancing and decamped. The moon peeped out again as
they were going off, and the Subaltern, Corporal and the two men accounted
for at least half a dozen of them. These dark figures which rolled up like
rabbits were the first Germans the Chicken had seen.</p>

<p>The Subaltern entered the house with the two privates and sent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Corporal back to tell the Colonel that we were in possession. He had taken
a rather important Observation Post marked 2.22 on the map.</p>

<p>I had some of the story from the boy and some from the Colonel, but I
will let the boy finish it.</p>

<p>"The next day we had some burying," he said. "From the new post
we could send out patrols to bring in our fellows who had been knocked out
on the 12th. You won't mind me talking about things which make you
feel a bit squeamish, will you, Sir?"&mdash;the boy called everybody above the
age of forty "Sir"&mdash;"Tell me to shut up if it is too beastly; but, you see,
most of these bodies had been out for six weeks and were more or less decomposed.
We dug a shallow trench towards them, threw out a hook on a bit
of rope and drew them in. We had to find their identification discs. It
was not a pleasant business taking off a man's shirt and not always easy,
and my Corporal being sick every minute didn't help things either. I
generally went for their pockets for letters; that was easier, but ..." I
omit here some details which are too unpleasant to print. "The Corporal
with his weak stomach was a bit of a nuisance, especially at night, for if the
Germans heard him they would send up a flare."</p>

<p>Then he told me about a frontal attack at Loos. The Chicken had seen
and suffered more and lived more in six months in France, and done
more for England than I had in two score odd years. He was clearly
a born soldier. He was happy in the regiment and quite one of them&mdash;one
of the new incarnation at least who approximate in some ways to the
old. I could not see what more he desired.</p>

<p>"You really think of throwing up the army after the war?" I asked.
The Chicken turned on me the wistful smile that talk of "after the war"
evoked among the sanguine at the time. "In war time of course everybody
has got to be a soldier," he said, "but in peace time&mdash;no thank you!"</p>

<p>"But what are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Anything, but inspect meat and tunic buttons. Something that counts.
I suppose I shall go into the Bar or Parliament."</p>

<p>I would have asked him if he really thought these talking shops counted
more than the Perthshires; but the pipes were coming in again and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
were playing the regimental slogan. It gave one the most extraordinary
feeling in the pit of one's stomach and all down one's back.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure, though," the boy said ingenuously when they had gone out,
"I may stick to the regiment on the chance of another show."</p>

<p>I understood, I had passed through the two moods myself in a long route
march when the pipes took over charge from the brass band.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
